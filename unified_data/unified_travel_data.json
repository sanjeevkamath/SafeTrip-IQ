Do not travel to Afghanistan due to civil unrest, crime, terrorism, risk of wrongful detention, kidnapping, and limited health facilities. Country Summary: The U.S. Embassy in Kabul suspended operations in 2021. The U.S. government is not able to provide routine or emergency consular services to U.S. citizens in Afghanistan. Multiple terrorist groups are active in Afghanistan and U.S. citizens are targets of kidnapping and hostage-taking. The Taliban have harassed and detained aid and humanitarian workers. The activities of foreigners may be viewed with suspicion, and reasons for detention may be unclear. Even if you are registered with the appropriate authorities to conduct business, the risk of detention is high. The Department has determined there is a risk of wrongful detention of U.S. nationals in Afghanistan. Additionally, Afghan-U.S. citizens and U.S. Lawful Permanent Residents (LPRs) who previously supported the United States (for example, as an interpreter) in Afghanistan may be targeted for detention. The Taliban do not regularly permit the United States to conduct welfare checks on U.S. citizens in detention, including by phone. Detention can be lengthy. While in detention, U.S. citizens have limited or no access to medical attention and may be subject to physical abuse. U.S. citizens should not travel to Afghanistan for any reason, including to accompany eligible family members for relocation. U.S. citizens or LPRs do not have to be physically present in Afghanistan for their qualifying family members to receive such assistance. For further information on how to assist your family members with the immigrant visa application process or to request relocation assistance for family, please refer to our website . U.S. citizens in Afghanistan are urged to depart immediately via commercial means if possible. U.S. citizens who are seeking U.S. government assistance to depart should email complete biographic details and contact information (email and phone number), as well as U.S. passport number, to AfghanistanACS@state.gov . Basic medical care is available in major Afghan cities such as Kabul but is limited in rural areas. Read the country information page for additional information on travel to Afghanistan. If you choose to disregard the Travel Advisory and travel to Afghanistan: Review your personal security plans. Be aware of your surroundings and local security developments at all times. Keep a low profile. Monitor local media for breaking events and be prepared to adjust your plans. Keep travel documents up to date and easily accessible. Notify a trusted person of your travel and movement plans. Make contingency plans to leave when it is safe to do so that do not rely on U.S. government assistance. Draft a will and designate appropriate insurance beneficiaries and/or power of attorney. Discuss a plan with loved ones regarding care/custody of children, pets, property, belongings, non-liquid assets (collections, artwork, etc.), funeral wishes, etc. Leave DNA samples with your medical provider in case it is necessary for your family to access them.

Even in areas that police or local governments deem safe, the situation can change quickly. While some informal housing developments have clear boundaries, other such areas may be less obvious, and may be identified by crowded quarters, impoverished conditions, or irregular construction. Exercise caution near these communities as gang fighting and police clashes sometimes move beyond the confines of these areas. Check the Safety and Security Section on the country information page and consult the maps on the Embassy’s website for details about favelas. Do not travel to these areas for any reason.

    "advisory_text": "Do not travel to Belarus due to: The risk of harassment by Belarusian security officials. The arbitrary enforcement of local laws. The potential for civil unrest. Danger associated with its continued support of Russia’s war against Ukraine. Ordered Departure On February 28, 2022, the Department of State ordered the departure of U.S. government employees and the suspension of operations at U.S. Embassy Minsk. All consular services, routine and emergency, are suspended until further notice. The U.S. government has severely limited ability to help U.S. citizens in Belarus. U.S. citizens in Belarus who require consular services should leave the country immediately and contact a U.S. embassy or consulate in another country. Advisory Summary: The U.S. government has extremely limited ability to assist detained U.S. citizens. A U.S. citizen may not receive consular access and could face extended periods of detention with no contact with the outside world. Dual Citizenship Belarus does not recognize dual nationality. Belarus will not recognize your U.S. citizenship if you are a dual U.S.-Belarusian citizen or have a claim to Belarusian citizenship. Belarus repeatedly has blocked U.S. consular officers from visiting detained dual U.S.-Belarusian citizens. The Belarusian government has prevented dual U.S.-Belarusian citizens from leaving the country, and in some cases forced dual citizens into mandatory military service. Demonstrations In Belarus, peaceful assembly and freedom of speech are not protected rights. U.S. citizens should avoid demonstrations. Belarusian authorities have used excessive force to disperse demonstrators, including people peacefully demonstrating. Bystanders, including foreign nationals, face the possibility of arrest or detention. U.S. citizens near demonstrations have been arrested. Some have been victims of harassment or mistreatment by Belarusian officials. Belarusian officials unevenly enforce laws and regulations. Belarusian authorities have targeted individuals associated with independent and foreign media. Belarusian authorities have detained tens of thousands of individuals, including U.S. citizens, accused of links to opposition parties and involvement in political protests, even if these links or associated activities occurred outside Belarus. About 1,100 prisoners are currently in prison or otherwise detained for political activities that may not be considered crimes in the United States. The Belarusian authorities have denied prisoners access to their embassy and lawyers, as well as restricted communication with family outside prison Conditions in Belarusian detention facilities are extremely poor and there are credible accounts of prisoners being mistreated and abused while in custody. Electronic devices Reconsider bringing electronic devices into Belarus. U.S. citizens should assume all electronic communications and devices in Belarus are monitored by Belarusian security services. Belarusian security services have arrested U.S. citizens and other foreign nationals based on information found on electronic devices, including information that was created, transmitted, or stored while in another country. Air Travel There are few commercial air travel options available into and out of Belarus. Flights could be unavailable on short notice, and the availability of other transportation options could change at any time. Those wishing to leave Belarus should make their own travel plans. The U.S. government can only offer limited help to U.S. citizens trying to leave. Border crossings with neighboring states sometimes close with little notice. U.S. citizens should regularly reevaluate departure plans in the event of an emergency. On May 23, 2021, Belarusian authorities improperly forced the landing of a commercial plane transiting through Belarusian airspace in order to arrest an opposition journalist who was a passenger. On February 24, 2022, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued an ongoing Advisory Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) banning U.S. air carriers and commercial operators, U.S. pilots, and U.S. registered aircraft from operating in the Minsk Flight Information Region (UMMV) due to safety-of-flight risks associated with ongoing hostilities. The Federal Aviation Administration’s Prohibitions, Restrictions and Notices includes more information. Review the country information page for additional information on travel to Belarus. If you choose to disregard the Travel Advisory and travel to Belarus: Prepare a will and designate appropriate insurance beneficiaries or power of attorney.

Review this list of documents to prepare for your trip. Discuss a plan with loved ones regarding care and custody of children, pets, property, belongings, non-liquid assets (collections, artwork, etc.) funeral wishes, etc. Leave DNA samples with your medical providers in case it is necessary for your family to access them. Develop a communication plan with family, your employer or host organization. List how and when you’ll confirm you’re safe (text or call). Specify how often you will do this. Have evacuation plans that do not rely on U.S. government assistance. Review the information on what the U.S. government can and cannot do to assist you in an emergency while overseas . Visit our website for Travel to High-Risk Areas . Consider the unique risks of possessing dual U.S.-Belarusian nationality. Reconsider bringing electronic devices to Belarus.

    "advisory_text": "Updated to reflect information on power grid failures and Department of the Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) licenses for travel. Exercise increased caution in Cuba due to crime and unreliable electrical power . Country Summary: Petty crime is a risk for travelers in Cuba. This includes pick pocketing, purse snatchings, and car break-ins. Violent crime, including armed robbery and homicide, is also on the rise in Cuba. U.S. law and regulation prohibit travel to, from, or within Cuba for tourist activities. OFAC regulates travel to, from, and within Cuba by persons subject to U.S. jurisdiction, defined to include, among other things, all U.S. citizens or residents (wherever located) and anyone in the United States, regardless of their citizenship and nationality. Failure by a person subject to U.S. jurisdiction to act consistently with the regulations may result in penalties and criminal prosecution. Travel to Cuba without an OFAC license is illegal. Cuba's electrical supply is unreliable. Since October 2024, there have been several prolonged nationwide power outages. Scheduled and unscheduled power cuts lasting up to 12 hours occur daily in Havana, and even longer outside the capital. Some large businesses, hotels, hospitals, and institutions use generators during power outages. However, they may have trouble keeping the generators running during a long outage due to the inconsistent and scarce availability of fuel. U.S. citizens in Cuba or those planning to visit should check local news often to stay up to date. In Cuba, peaceful assembly and freedom of speech are not protected rights. U.S. citizens should avoid protests or demonstrations. U.S. Embassy employees must follow a special notification process with the Government of Cuba to travel outside of Havana. This process can impact the embassy's ability to help U.S. citizens in Cuba during emergencies. If a person subject to U.S. jurisdiction travels to Cuba consistent with 1 of the 12 travel categories authorized by a general OFAC license, the person would not need to apply for a specific OFAC license for the travel transactions. For non-tourist travel that is not otherwise covered by a general license, a person subject to U.S. jurisdiction must seek a specific license from OFAC to authorize the travel. For travel questions, check 31 C.F.R. 515.560 and OFAC’s Frequently Asked Questions . Read the country information page for additional information on travel to Cuba. If you decide to travel to Cuba: Stay aware of your surroundings. Do not physically resist any robbery attempt. Do not display signs of wealth, such as expensive watches or jewelry. Prepare for prolonged power outages by: Keeping mobile phones and portable battery banks charged. Having flashlights and spare batteries easily accessible. Stocking up on nonperishable food and water. Preparing alternative methods to meet your medical needs (medical devices requiring power, medicines requiring refrigeration, etc.) Obtain any required OFAC licenses as it is illegal to travel to Cuba without an appropriate license. Enroll in the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP) to receive messages and Alerts from the U.S. Embassy and make it easier to locate you in an emergency. Prepare a plan for emergency situations. Review the Traveler’s Checklist . Visit the CDC page for the latest Travel Health Information related to your travel and return to the United States.

In 2025, there were 43 political violence events. Advisory Details: Updated to reflect information on power grid failures and Department of the Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) licenses for travel. Exercise increased caution in Cuba due to crime and unreliable electrical power . Country Summary: Petty crime is a risk for travelers in Cuba. This includes pick pocketing, purse snatchings, and car break-ins. Violent crime, including armed robbery and homicide, is also on the rise in Cuba. U.S. law and regulation prohibit travel to, from, or within Cuba for tourist activities. OFAC regulates travel to, from, and within Cuba by persons subject to U.S. jurisdiction, defined to include, among other things, all U.S. citizens or residents (wherever located) and anyone in the United States, regardless of their citizenship and nationality. Failure by a person subject to U.S. jurisdiction to act consistently with the regulations may result in penalties and criminal prosecution. Travel to Cuba without an OFAC license is illegal. Cuba's electrical supply is unreliable. Since October 2024, there have been several prolonged nationwide power outages. Scheduled and unscheduled power cuts lasting up to 12 hours occur daily in Havana, and even longer outside the capital. Some large businesses, hotels, hospitals, and institutions use generators during power outages. However, they may have trouble keeping the generators running during a long outage due to the inconsistent and scarce availability of fuel. U.S. citizens in Cuba or those planning to visit should check local news often to stay up to date. In Cuba, peaceful assembly and freedom of speech are not protected rights. U.S. citizens should avoid protests or demonstrations. U.S. Embassy employees must follow a special notification process with the Government of Cuba to travel outside of Havana. This process can impact the embassy's ability to help U.S. citizens in Cuba during emergencies. If a person subject to U.S. jurisdiction travels to Cuba consistent with 1 of the 12 travel categories authorized by a general OFAC license, the person would not need to apply for a specific OFAC license for the travel transactions. For non-tourist travel that is not otherwise covered by a general license, a person subject to U.S. jurisdiction must seek a specific license from OFAC to authorize the travel. For travel questions, check 31 C.F.R. 515.560 and OFAC’s Frequently Asked Questions . Read the country information page for additional information on travel to Cuba. If you decide to travel to Cuba: Stay aware of your surroundings. Do not physically resist any robbery attempt. Do not display signs of wealth, such as expensive watches or jewelry. Prepare for prolonged power outages by: Keeping mobile phones and portable battery banks charged. Having flashlights and spare batteries easily accessible. Stocking up on nonperishable food and water. Preparing alternative methods to meet your medical needs (medical devices requiring power, medicines requiring refrigeration, etc.) Obtain any required OFAC licenses as it is illegal to travel to Cuba without an appropriate license. Enroll in the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP) to receive messages and Alerts from the U.S. Embassy and make it easier to locate you in an emergency. Prepare a plan for emergency situations. Review the Traveler’s Checklist . Visit the CDC page for the latest Travel Health Information related to your travel and return to the United States. We highly recommend buying insurance before you travel. Check with your travel insurance provider about evacuation assistance, medical insurance, and trip cancellation coverage."

The provinces of Sucumbios, Manabi, Santa Elena, and Santo Domingo due to crime . Country Summary: Crime is a widespread problem in Ecuador. Violent crime, such as murder, assault, kidnapping, and armed robbery, is prevalent and widespread. The rate of violent crime is significantly higher in areas where transnational criminal organizations are concentrated. Demonstrations occur frequently throughout the country, usually motivated by political and/or economic factors. Demonstrators routinely block local roads and major highways, often without prior notice which can lead to disruption in access to critical infrastructure. Outside of Ecuador’s major towns and cities, much of the country’s territory is sparsely populated and isolated. Government assistance may be very limited and can lead to significant delays for assistance to U.S. citizens in remote areas. Land Border Restrictions : All foreign citizens entering the country via land border crossings from Colombia or Peru are required to present an apostilled certificate showing a lack of criminal record. Further information is available on the Ministry of Tourism’s webpage and at Ecuador.Travel . All U.S. citizens planning to enter Ecuador via a land border should comply with this requirement. See Travel.State.Gov ’s Office of Authentications webpage and Criminal Records Check webpage for information on how to obtain a criminal record check and apostille from the United States. The U.S. Embassy and Consulate General in Ecuador cannot assist citizens crossing a land border in obtaining the required documentation.

Country Summary: Crime is a widespread problem in Ecuador. Violent crime, such as murder, assault, kidnapping, and armed robbery, is prevalent and widespread. The rate of violent crime is significantly higher in areas where transnational criminal organizations are concentrated. Demonstrations occur frequently throughout the country, usually motivated by political and/or economic factors. Demonstrators routinely block local roads and major highways, often without prior notice which can lead to disruption in access to critical infrastructure. Outside of Ecuador’s major towns and cities, much of the country’s territory is sparsely populated and isolated. Government assistance may be very limited and can lead to significant delays for assistance to U.S. citizens in remote areas. Land Border Restrictions : All foreign citizens entering the country via land border crossings from Colombia or Peru are required to present an apostilled certificate showing a lack of criminal record. Further information is available on the Ministry of Tourism’s webpage and at Ecuador.Travel . All U.S. citizens planning to enter Ecuador via a land border should comply with this requirement. See Travel.State.Gov ’s Office of Authentications webpage and Criminal Records Check webpage for information on how to obtain a criminal record check and apostille from the United States. The U.S. Embassy and Consulate General in Ecuador cannot assist citizens crossing a land border in obtaining the required documentation.

Zone 18 in Guatemala City and the city of Villa Nueva due to crime . Country Summary: Some areas of Guatemala have problems with gangs, robbery, carjacking, drug trafficking and violence. Local law enforcement may not always respond well to serious crimes, leading to low arrest and conviction rates. While tourists are not usually targeted, they can still be victims of opportunistic crimes. Guatemala has a program called the Tourist Assistance Program ( ASISTUR ) that helps protect tourists. ASISTUR works with tourist police (DISETUR) in popular areas like Antigua, Lake Atitlán, Tikal, Quetzaltenango, Puerto Barrios, and Coban. They also have an emergency call center that speaks both Spanish and English. Tourist groups can request a security escort if they have safety concerns. You can call them anytime by dialing 1500 from a Guatemalan phone number or (502) 2290-2810, and you can also reach them on WhatsApp at +502-5188-1819.

They can travel to other parts of Guatemala and visit popular places like Tikal, Antigua, Lake Atitlán, and the Pacific coast areas in the Santa Rosa and Escuintla. However, they should avoid driving outside Guatemala City at night because of poor lighting and safety risks. They may not use white car taxis or public transportation, like “chicken buses” due to the high chance of crime and injury. Check the country information page for helpful information about traveling to Guatemala. This includes information on entry and exit rules, safety, local laws, health, and getting around. Also, visit the U.S. Embassy in Guatemala City ’s website for local resources, like legal help, medical services, driver’s licenses, and information on residence and work permits, as well as rules about bringing weapons into Guatemala. If you decide to travel to Guatemala: Do not travel outside Guatemala City at night because the roads are poorly lit, and there is a high risk for serious traffic accidents. When visiting Lake Atitlán, use certified tour guides and travel between villages by chartered boat. The paths around the lake can be dangerous and hard to access. Emergency services cannot arrive quickly to help. Avoid swimming in the Pacific Ocean because the currents and undertow are very strong, and there are not many lifeguards. Never leave drinks unattended in bars and restaurants and say no to invitations from strangers to private parties. Consider staying in hotels that have secure parking, doormen, and professional security staff. Use trusted taxi services like Taxis Amarillo Express, Taxi Seguro, or Uber, and only use INGUAT-approved taxis from the “SAFE” stand at the airport, hotel taxis, or vetted private drivers. Avoid public transport and white car taxis, as well as “chicken buses.” Do not hike trails or volcanoes without a qualified local guide, as robberies can happen and getting help can be difficult. Avoid using public ATMs, and do not show signs of wealth like wearing expensive watches or jewelry. Also, try not to use your phone in public.

Read the entire Travel Advisory. Country Summary: In July 2023, the Department of State ordered nonemergency U.S. government employees and their family members to leave the country due to security risks. Haiti has been under a State of Emergency since March 2024. Crimes involving firearms are common in Haiti. They include robbery, carjackings, sexual assault, and kidnappings for ransom. Do not travel to Haiti for any reason. Kidnapping Kidnapping is widespread. U.S. citizens have been victims and have been hurt or killed. Kidnappers may: Plan with precision or target victims during unexpected times. Target and attack convoys. Demand ransoms. U.S. victims’ families have paid tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars to rescue their family members. Demonstrations Protests, demonstrations, and roadblocks are common and unpredictable. They often damage or destroy infrastructure and can become violent. Mob killings and public assaults are on the rise. People are targeting those they think have committed crimes. Toussaint Louverture I nternational Airport Exchanges of gunfire with criminal gangs, organized crime, and terrorists have occurred in the neighborhood just outside the Port-au-Prince International Airport (PAP). Travelers are sometimes followed and violently attacked and robbed shortly after leaving the airport, or while entering or leaving hotels in Port-au-Prince. U.S. commercial flights do not currently operate to and from Port-au-Prince. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) prohibiting U.S. air carrier flights to Port-au-Prince due to the ongoing instability. Please check FAA's website for more information. Crime and Terrorism There is widespread violent crime and organized crime in the country, and local law enforcement has limited ability to respond to serious crimes. Violent crime is rampant in Haiti, especially in Port-au-Prince, where the expansion of gang, organized crime, and terrorist activity has led to widespread violence, kidnappings, and sexual assault. The escalation of clashes between armed groups has led to a rise in sporadic gunfire incidents. There is a substantial risk of being struck by stray bullets, even for individuals not directly involved in the violence. There is risk of terrorist violence, including attacks and other violent gang activity in Haiti. There are gangs that are designated as terrorist organizations present in Haiti. Transportation and Travel Do not cross the border by land between Haiti and the Dominican Republic. There is a risk of kidnapping and violence. These dangers are present on roads from major Haitian cities to the border. The U.S. Embassy cannot help you enter the Dominican Republic by air, land, or sea. U.S. citizens who cross into the Dominican Republic at an unofficial crossing may face high immigration fines when they try to leave. The U.S. Coast Guard has concerns about security in the ports of Haiti. Until those are addressed, the Coast Guard advises mariners and passengers traveling through the ports of Haiti to exercise caution. Limited Emergency Response The U.S. government is very limited in its ability to help U.S. citizens in Haiti. Local police and first responders often do not have enough resources. This limits their ability to respond to emergencies or serious crimes. Shortages of gasoline, electricity, medicine, and medical supplies are common throughout the country. Public and private clinics, as well as hospitals, have untrained staff and lack basic resources. Medical providers almost always require upfront payment in cash. U.S. government employees must follow a nightly curfew. Families of Embassy personnel are not allowed to accompany them on their assignment. Embassy personnel cannot travel by foot in Port-au-Prince. U.S. government employees working in Haiti must obtain special permission to travel outside the embassy compound due to security risks. They are also prohibited from: Using any kind of public transportation or taxis. Visiting banks and using ATMs. Driving at night. Traveling anywhere after dark. Read the country information page for additional information on travel to Haiti. If you decide to travel to Haiti: Avoid demonstrations and crowds. Check local media for breaking events. Be prepared to adjust your plans. Arrange airport transfers and hotels in advance, or have your host meet you upon arrival. Keep travel documents up to date and easily accessible. Have evacuation plans that do not rely on U.S. government assistance. Bring enough supply of over the counter and prescription medicines. If you are being followed as you leave the airport, drive to the nearest police station immediately. Develop a communication plan with family or your employer or host organization (if you are traveling on business). This is so they can monitor your safety and location as you travel through high-risk areas. Specify how you will confirm you are safe (text, calls, etc.), how often, and who you will contact first to share the information. Choose one family member to serve as the point of contact. They will communicate with kidnappers or hostage-takers, media, U.S. and host country government agencies, and members of Congress if you are kidnapped or taken hostage. Establish a proof of life protocol with your loved ones. This is so that if you are taken hostage, your loved ones can know specific questions (and answers) to ask the hostage-takers to be sure that you are alive (and to rule out a hoax). Draft a will and designate appropriate insurance beneficiaries and/or power of attorney, put your financial affairs in order. Discuss a plan with loved ones regarding care/custody of children, pets, property, belongings, non-liquid assets (collections, artwork, etc.), funeral wishes, etc. Leave DNA samples with your medical provider in case it is necessary for your family to access them. Travel by vehicle to reduce walking in public. Travel in groups or at least do not travel alone. Always keep vehicle doors locked, and windows closed when driving. Roadblocks may be operated by gangs, members of organized crime, or terrorists seeking money and may turn violent. Be cautious and alert. This is especially important when driving through markets and other crowded areas. Do not physically resist any robbery attempt. Visit our website for Travel to High-Risk Areas .

They will communicate with kidnappers or hostage-takers, media, U.S. and host country government agencies, and members of Congress if you are kidnapped or taken hostage. Establish a proof of life protocol with your loved ones. This is so that if you are taken hostage, your loved ones can know specific questions (and answers) to ask the hostage-takers to be sure that you are alive (and to rule out a hoax).

Do not travel to Iran due to the risk of terrorism, civil unrest, kidnapping, arbitrary arrest of U.S. citizens, and wrongful detention. Country Summary: Do not travel to Iran for any reason. U.S. citizens in Iran face serious dangers. They have been kidnapped and wrongfully arrested. Some have been held for years on false charges, subjected to psychological torture, and even sentenced to death. The U.S. government does not have diplomatic or consular relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran. The Swiss government, acting through its Embassy in Tehran, serves as the protecting power for United States interests in Iran. The Department of State has determined that U.S. nationals traveling to Iran are at significant risk of wrongful detention. Iranian authorities continue to unjustly detain U.S. nationals without warning or any evidence they committed a crime. This includes dual U.S.-Iranian nationals, students, journalists, business travelers, academics, and individuals with U.S. military or government experience. Charges include espionage and posing a threat to national security. U.S. nationals are at significant risk of questioning, arrest, and detention in Iran. Having a U.S. passport or connections to the United States can be reason enough for Iranian authorities to detain someone. Iranian authorities routinely delay consular access to detained U.S. nationals. In particular, Iranian authorities consistently deny consular access to dual U.S.-Iranian nationals. Terrorism Violent extremist groups, including U.S. government-designated terrorist organizations, operate in Iran. ISIS and related groups have taken responsibility for bombings and other attacks in the country. The risk of terrorism and deadly harm to bystanders continues. Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) and Surrogacy Companies offering surrogacy services in Iran are grossly misrepresenting the security situation in Iran and risks of the unregulated surrogacy tourism industry. Private companies that organize these visits and services put U.S. citizens in danger. Iranian surrogacy providers have also been known to misrepresent U.S. citizenship law; if a child born overseas to a surrogate is not genetically or gestationally related to a U.S. citizen parent or the spouse of a U.S. citizen, the child will not automatically acquire U.S. citizenship at birth and will not be able to obtain a U.S. passport to leave Iran.

    "advisory_text": "Updated to reflect the lifting of ordered departure of family members and non-emergency U.S. government personnel. Do Not Travel to Lebanon due to crime, terrorism, civil unrest, kidnapping, unexploded landmines, and the risk of armed conflict . Some areas, especially near the borders, have increased risk. Read the entire Travel Advisory. U.S. Embassy Beirut personnel are restricted from personal travel without advance permission. Additional travel restrictions may be imposed on U.S. personnel under Chief of Mission security responsibility, with little to no notice due to increased security issues or threats. Commercial flights are available, but at reduced capacity. Please check flight options at Beirut–Rafic Hariri International Airport . Country Summary: U.S. citizens in Lebanon should be aware that consular officers from the U.S. Embassy are not always able to travel to assist them. The Department of State considers the threat to U.S. government personnel in Beirut serious enough to require them to live and work under strict security. The internal security policies of the U.S. Embassy may be adjusted at any time and without advance notice. Since October 8, 2023, cross-border exchanges of fire have occurred between Hizballah and Israel. In some instances, targets have been well north of the border region. A cessation of hostilities between Israel and Lebanon went into effect on November 27, and implementation is ongoing; however, there are continued instances of military activity in some areas of Lebanon. The Lebanese government cannot guarantee the safety of U.S. citizens against sudden outbreaks of violence and armed conflict. Family, neighborhood, or sectarian disputes can escalate quickly and can lead to gunfire or other violence with no warning. Terrorist groups continue plotting possible attacks in Lebanon. Terrorists may conduct attacks with little or no warning targeting tourist locations, transportation hubs, markets/shopping malls, and local government facilities. Local security authorities have noted a rise in violent crimes, including political violence. Multiple unsolved killings in Lebanon may have been politically motivated. Kidnapping, whether for ransom, political motives, or family disputes, has occurred in Lebanon. Suspects in kidnappings may have ties to terrorist or criminal organizations. Unexploded landmines and explosive remnants of war are a hazard along the border with Syria. Heed land mine warning signs. Do not venture off the road into areas marked off with red and white plastic tape. Avoid roadside ditches, shoulders, and unmarked trails. Never touch anything resembling unexploded munitions. U.S. citizens should avoid demonstrations and exercise caution if in the vicinity of any large gatherings or protests as these have the potential to turn violent quickly and with little notice. Protesters have blocked major roads, including thoroughfares between downtown Beirut and the area where the U.S. Embassy is located, and between Beirut and Beirut-Rafic Hariri International Airport. Read the country information page for additional information on travel to Lebanon. If you decide to travel to Lebanon: Visit our website for information on Travel to High-Risk Areas . Appoint one family member to serve as the point of contact with kidnappers/hostage-takers, media, U.S. and host country government agencies, and members of Congress if you are kidnapped, or taken hostage. Keep travel documents up to date and easily accessible. Do not touch unknown metal objects and avoid traveling off well-used roads, tracks, and paths due to risk of unexploded ordnance. Avoid demonstrations and crowds. Stay alert in locations frequented by Westerners. Monitor local media for breaking events and adjust your plans based on new information. Enroll in the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program ( STEP ) to receive Alerts and make it easier to locate you in an emergency. Follow the Department of State on Facebook and X/Twitter . Review the Country Security Report for Lebanon. Visit the CDC page for the latest Travel Health Information related to your travel. U.S. citizens who travel abroad should always have a contingency plan for emergency situations. Review the Traveler’s Checklist . Southern Lebanon – Level 4: Do Not Travel, Depart If You Are There (See map below) The U.S. Embassy strongly urges U.S. citizens to avoid southern Lebanon and to depart if you are there; that is, all parts south of the city of Saida, to include inland areas, as illustrated in the map below. There have continued to be instances of military activity in South Lebanon and near the Syrian border since the cessation of hostilities went into effect. Border with Syria – Level 4: Do Not Travel, Depart If You Are There The U.S. Embassy strongly urges U.S. citizens to avoid the Lebanon-Syria border and to depart if you are there. This area has seen clashes between Lebanese security forces and Syrian-based groups, as well as recent airstrikes. The U.S. Department of State also warns U.S. citizens of the risk of traveling on flights that fly over Syria, which include some flights to and from Beirut.

    "bert_input_text": "Country: Lebanon. Travel Advisory: Level 4: Do Not Travel. The Global Peace Index score is 2.674. The Global Terrorism Index score is 1.237. In 2025, there were 1494 political violence events. Advisory Details: Updated to reflect the lifting of ordered departure of family members and non-emergency U.S. government personnel. Do Not Travel to Lebanon due to crime, terrorism, civil unrest, kidnapping, unexploded landmines, and the risk of armed conflict . Some areas, especially near the borders, have increased risk. Read the entire Travel Advisory. U.S. Embassy Beirut personnel are restricted from personal travel without advance permission. Additional travel restrictions may be imposed on U.S. personnel under Chief of Mission security responsibility, with little to no notice due to increased security issues or threats. Commercial flights are available, but at reduced capacity. Please check flight options at Beirut–Rafic Hariri International Airport . Country Summary: U.S. citizens in Lebanon should be aware that consular officers from the U.S. Embassy are not always able to travel to assist them. The Department of State considers the threat to U.S. government personnel in Beirut serious enough to require them to live and work under strict security. The internal security policies of the U.S. Embassy may be adjusted at any time and without advance notice. Since October 8, 2023, cross-border exchanges of fire have occurred between Hizballah and Israel. In some instances, targets have been well north of the border region. A cessation of hostilities between Israel and Lebanon went into effect on November 27, and implementation is ongoing; however, there are continued instances of military activity in some areas of Lebanon. The Lebanese government cannot guarantee the safety of U.S. citizens against sudden outbreaks of violence and armed conflict. Family, neighborhood, or sectarian disputes can escalate quickly and can lead to gunfire or other violence with no warning. Terrorist groups continue plotting possible attacks in Lebanon. Terrorists may conduct attacks with little or no warning targeting tourist locations, transportation hubs, markets/shopping malls, and local government facilities. Local security authorities have noted a rise in violent crimes, including political violence. Multiple unsolved killings in Lebanon may have been politically motivated. Kidnapping, whether for ransom, political motives, or family disputes, has occurred in Lebanon. Suspects in kidnappings may have ties to terrorist or criminal organizations. Unexploded landmines and explosive remnants of war are a hazard along the border with Syria. Heed land mine warning signs. Do not venture off the road into areas marked off with red and white plastic tape. Avoid roadside ditches, shoulders, and unmarked trails. Never touch anything resembling unexploded munitions. U.S. citizens should avoid demonstrations and exercise caution if in the vicinity of any large gatherings or protests as these have the potential to turn violent quickly and with little notice. Protesters have blocked major roads, including thoroughfares between downtown Beirut and the area where the U.S. Embassy is located, and between Beirut and Beirut-Rafic Hariri International Airport. Read the country information page for additional information on travel to Lebanon. If you decide to travel to Lebanon: Visit our website for information on Travel to High-Risk Areas . Appoint one family member to serve as the point of contact with kidnappers/hostage-takers, media, U.S. and host country government agencies, and members of Congress if you are kidnapped, or taken hostage. Keep travel documents up to date and easily accessible. Do not touch unknown metal objects and avoid traveling off well-used roads, tracks, and paths due to risk of unexploded ordnance. Avoid demonstrations and crowds. Stay alert in locations frequented by Westerners. Monitor local media for breaking events and adjust your plans based on new information. Enroll in the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program ( STEP ) to receive Alerts and make it easier to locate you in an emergency. Follow the Department of State on Facebook and X/Twitter .

Border with Syria – Level 4: Do Not Travel, Depart If You Are There The U.S. Embassy strongly urges U.S. citizens to avoid the Lebanon-Syria border and to depart if you are there.

    "advisory_text": "Reissued after periodic review with minor edits. Do not travel to Libya for any reason due to crime , terrorism , unexploded landmines , civil unrest , kidnapping , and armed conflict . Read entire Travel Advisory. Country Summary : Terrorism: There is risk of terrorist violence, including terrorist attacks and other activity in Libya. Visit the U.S. Department of State's country reports on terrorism to learn more. Terrorist attacks could occur with little or no warning, targeting public spaces like tourist locations, hotels, transportation hubs, markets/shopping malls, and government facilities. Kidnapping is widespread, and victims have included U.S. citizens. Kidnappers may take advantage of unplanned opportunities. Criminal or armed individuals or groups have threatened to and/or have seized or detained and threatened to kill, injure, or continue to detain individuals in order to compel a third party (including a governmental organization) to do or abstain from doing something as a condition of release. Unexploded landmines, cluster munitions, and unexploded ammunition are a hazard throughout Libya. Heed land mine warning signs. Do not venture off the road into areas marked with red and white plastic tape. Avoid roadside ditches, shoulders, and unmarked trails. Never touch anything resembling unexploded munitions. Landmines do exist in populated areas due to numerous ground offensives in the last decade. Outbreaks of violence between competing armed groups can occur with little warning and have the potential to impact U.S. citizens. The capital, Tripoli, and other cities, such as Surman, Al-Jufra, Misrata, Ajdabiya, Benghazi, and Zuwara, have witnessed fighting among armed groups. Hotels and airports frequented by U.S. citizens have been the targets of these attacks. Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and escalate into violence. Armed groups sometimes detain travelers for arbitrary reasons, do not grant detainees access to lawyers or legal processes, and do not allow detainees to inform others of their status. U.S. citizens should carry proof of citizenship and valid immigration status at all times, but having these documents does not guarantee fair treatment. While there are operational international airports in Libya with regular domestic and international flights, flights are often delayed, rerouted, and cancelled without warning. The U.S. government prohibits U.S. commercial aviation operations within Libyan airspace. Due to risks to civil aviation operating within or in the vicinity of Libya, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Air Missions (NOTAM) and a Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR). For more information U.S. citizens should consult the Federal Aviation Administration’s Prohibitions, Restrictions and Notices . The Commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard has determined that effective anti-terrorism measures are not in place in Libyan ports and has imposed conditions of entry on vessels that arrive in U.S. ports having visited ports in Libya. Mariners and passengers traveling through the ports of Libya should exercise caution. U.S. citizens in Libya in need of routine consular services should contact the U.S. Embassy in Tunis, Tunisia for assistance. To contact the U.S. Embassy in Tunis, click here . U.S. citizens who are in Libya are urged to depart as soon as possible via commercial means if possible. The Department of State will continue to provide information via the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP), Embassy Libya's web page , Travel.State.Gov , Facebook , and X . Read the country information page for additional information on travel to Libya. If you decide to travel to Libya: Visit our website for Travel to High-Risk Areas . Carry proof of citizenship and valid immigration status at all times. Avoid demonstrations and crowds. Make contingency plans to leave. Draft a will and designate appropriate insurance beneficiaries and a power of attorney. Discuss a plan with loved ones regarding care or custody of children, pets, property, belongings, non-liquid assets (collections, artwork, etc.), funeral wishes, etcetera. Establish your own personal security plan in coordination with your family, and employer or host organization, so that they can monitor your safety and location.

In 2025, there were 281 political violence events. Advisory Details: Reissued after periodic review with minor edits. Do not travel to Libya for any reason due to crime , terrorism , unexploded landmines , civil unrest , kidnapping , and armed conflict . Read entire Travel Advisory. Country Summary : Terrorism: There is risk of terrorist violence, including terrorist attacks and other activity in Libya. Visit the U.S. Department of State's country reports on terrorism to learn more. Terrorist attacks could occur with little or no warning, targeting public spaces like tourist locations, hotels, transportation hubs, markets/shopping malls, and government facilities. Kidnapping is widespread, and victims have included U.S. citizens. Kidnappers may take advantage of unplanned opportunities. Criminal or armed individuals or groups have threatened to and/or have seized or detained and threatened to kill, injure, or continue to detain individuals in order to compel a third party (including a governmental organization) to do or abstain from doing something as a condition of release. Unexploded landmines, cluster munitions, and unexploded ammunition are a hazard throughout Libya. Heed land mine warning signs. Do not venture off the road into areas marked with red and white plastic tape. Avoid roadside ditches, shoulders, and unmarked trails. Never touch anything resembling unexploded munitions. Landmines do exist in populated areas due to numerous ground offensives in the last decade. Outbreaks of violence between competing armed groups can occur with little warning and have the potential to impact U.S. citizens. The capital, Tripoli, and other cities, such as Surman, Al-Jufra, Misrata, Ajdabiya, Benghazi, and Zuwara, have witnessed fighting among armed groups. Hotels and airports frequented by U.S. citizens have been the targets of these attacks. Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and escalate into violence. Armed groups sometimes detain travelers for arbitrary reasons, do not grant detainees access to lawyers or legal processes, and do not allow detainees to inform others of their status. U.S. citizens should carry proof of citizenship and valid immigration status at all times, but having these documents does not guarantee fair treatment. While there are operational international airports in Libya with regular domestic and international flights, flights are often delayed, rerouted, and cancelled without warning. The U.S. government prohibits U.S. commercial aviation operations within Libyan airspace. Due to risks to civil aviation operating within or in the vicinity of Libya, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Air Missions (NOTAM) and a Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR). For more information U.S. citizens should consult the Federal Aviation Administration’s Prohibitions, Restrictions and Notices . The Commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard has determined that effective anti-terrorism measures are not in place in Libyan ports and has imposed conditions of entry on vessels that arrive in U.S. ports having visited ports in Libya. Mariners and passengers traveling through the ports of Libya should exercise caution. U.S. citizens in Libya in need of routine consular services should contact the U.S. Embassy in Tunis, Tunisia for assistance. To contact the U.S. Embassy in Tunis, click here . U.S. citizens who are in Libya are urged to depart as soon as possible via commercial means if possible. The Department of State will continue to provide information via the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP), Embassy Libya's web page , Travel.State.Gov , Facebook , and X . Read the country information page for additional information on travel to Libya. If you decide to travel to Libya: Visit our website for Travel to High-Risk Areas . Carry proof of citizenship and valid immigration status at all times. Avoid demonstrations and crowds. Make contingency plans to leave. Draft a will and designate appropriate insurance beneficiaries and a power of attorney. Discuss a plan with loved ones regarding care or custody of children, pets, property, belongings, non-liquid assets (collections, artwork, etc.), funeral wishes, etcetera. Establish your own personal security plan in coordination with your family, and employer or host organization, so that they can monitor your safety and location.

    "advisory_text": "Updated to reflect changes to risk indicators, restrictions on U.S. government personnel, and the “ If you decide to travel to Burma” section. Do not travel to Burma due to armed conflict, the potential for civil unrest, arbitrary enforcement of local laws, poor health infrastructure, land mines and unexploded ordnance, crime, and wrongful detentions . Country Summary: The Burma military regime deposed elected leaders and officials in a February 2021 coup d'état. Protests and demonstrations against military rule can occur on significant dates. The military has responded to those protests with violence and by arbitrarily detaining protesters and bystanders. The Department has determined that U.S. nationals are at significant risk of wrongful detention by military regime authorities. Wrongfully detained U.S. nationals have been held in prison for years, often in poor conditions and without fair and transparent treatment or consistent access to U.S. Embassy officials or their families. Due to the unpredictable nature of ongoing armed conflict and potential civil unrest in Burma, U.S. government employees working in Burma may be prohibited from traveling within the country. Due to the risks in the country, dependents under the age of 21 cannot accompany U.S. government employees who work in Burma. Armed conflicts occur throughout Burma, and the potential for civil unrest is high. The level of armed conflict and civil unrest varies significantly between and within states and regions and may change at any time. Attacks by opposition militia on locations connected to the military and security authorities regularly occur in Rangoon and many other parts of the country. Local opposition militia groups actively operate around the country. Travelers are cautioned of the potential for the regime to limit access to highways and airports, causing an isolating situation. Improvised explosive devices (IEDs) are used in the ongoing armed conflicts, including within the greater Rangoon area. From January to December 2024, the U.S. Embassy in Rangoon calculated an average of 21 explosions per month detonated against regime personnel and facilities in Rangoon. Outside of Rangoon, there have been IED attacks against checkpoints and military, administrative, and police facilities. Land mines and unexploded ordnance (UXO) exist throughout Burma, and their locations are often not marked or otherwise unidentifiable. The military regime will often arbitrarily enforce local laws , including detaining individuals without fair and transparent treatment . Foreigners, including U.S. citizens, are not excluded from this practice. U.S. citizens traveling or residing in Burma may be detained, and regime authorities could deny a prisoner access to U.S. consular services or information about the alleged crime. Local law enforcement officials may also detain and/or deport U.S. citizens for speaking out or protesting against the military regime, including on their personal social media accounts, and for sending private electronic messages critical of the military regime, regardless of whether they were physically in Burma when they did so. Burma has limited and/or inadequate healthcare and emergency medical resources. As of April 2024, the Burma military regime began implementing a military conscription law for males up to age 45 and females up to age 35. The military regime may prevent departure of people they view as eligible for conscription, including U.S. citizens who previously held Burmese nationality, and force them into the military. Crime in Burma has been increasing. Violent crime against foreigners is rare, but there have been incidents involving attacks by taxi drivers and muggings. People are advised to take particular care when taking taxis late at night. Foreign nationals, including U.S. citizens, have been trafficked into Burma and forced to work in internet scam centers, often located in active conflict zones along Burma's eastern borders. These victims often respond to ads promising jobs in Thailand and are then forced or unwittingly lured into working at scam centers in Burma.

Reconsider travel to Nigeria due to crime , terrorism , civil unrest , kidnapping , armed gangs, and inconsistent availability of health care services . Some places in Nigeria have an increased risk. Overall, all locations carry significant security risks. Read the entire Travel Advisory. Do Not Travel to : Borno, Yobe, Kogi, and northern Adamawa states due to terrorism and kidnapping Bauchi, Gombe, Kaduna, Kano, Katsina, Sokoto, and Zamfara states due to kidnapping Abia, Anambra, Bayelsa, Delta, Enugu, Imo, and Rivers states (with the exception of Port Harcourt) due to crime , kidnapping , and armed gangs. Country Summary : Violent crime is common in the country. This includes armed robbery, assault, carjacking, kidnapping, hostage-taking, roadside banditry, and rape. Kidnappings for ransom happen often. They primarily target dual national citizens visiting Nigeria and U.S. citizens perceived as wealthy. Kidnapping gangs have also stopped victims on interstate roads. Terrorism There is risk of terrorist violence in Nigeria. This includes terrorist attacks and other activities. Terrorists continue plotting and carrying out attacks in Nigeria. Terrorists collaborate with local gangs to expand their reach. They may attack with little or no warning, including: Shopping centers and malls Markets Hotels Places of worship Restaurants and bars Schools Government buildings Transportation hubs Public places where crowds gather Visit the U.S. Department of State's country reports on terrorism to learn more. Gangs and crime Civil unrest and armed gangs are active in parts of Southern Nigeria. This is especially true in the Niger Delta and Southeast regions. Armed crime and gangs are common in the area. Crimes include kidnapping and assaults on Nigerian security services. Violence can flare up between communities of farmers and herders in rural areas. Unreliable health care U.S. citizens should not expect the same level of health care to be available in Nigeria as they do in the United States: Nigerian medical facilities are generally not equipped to U.S. or European standards. Many medicines are not available. This includes common medications for diabetes or asthma. Bring enough over-the-counter and prescription medicines to last your entire stay in Nigeria. Update vaccinations to include all standard vaccinations, plus yellow fever, meningitis, typhoid, cholera, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and a polio booster. All visitors should take Malaria prophylaxis. Nigeria is high risk for Malaria. Counterfeit pharmaceuticals are a common problem. Hospitals often expect immediate cash payment for health services. Most hospitals and doctors do not accept U.S. health insurance. Emergency services like those in the United States or Europe do not exist. Blood supply is often unreliable. Ambulance services are unreliable, have poor equipment, and often do not have trained paramedics. We strongly recommend getting traveler’s insurance, including medical evacuation insurance, before traveling. The Department of State does not pay medical bills for U.S. citizens overseas. U.S. Medicare/Medicaid do not work overseas. Due to security risks, U.S. government employees cannot provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in many areas of Nigeria. Read the country information page for additional information on travel to Nigeria. If you decide to travel to Nigeria: Carry proper identification, including a U.S. passport with a current Nigerian visa, if needed. Use caution when walking or driving. Keep a low profile. Review travel routes and times. Vary your predictability. Do not physically resist any robbery attempt. Be extra vigilant when visiting banks or ATMs. Check local media for breaking events and be prepared to adjust your plans. Be aware of your surroundings. Stay alert in locations frequented by foreign tourists. Avoid demonstrations and large political gatherings. Review your personal security plans. Have evacuation plans that do not depend on U.S. government help. Establish a “proof of life” protocol with your loved ones, so that if you are taken hostage, your loved ones know specific questions (and answers) to ask the hostage-takers to be sure that you are alive. This helps to rule out scams. Enroll in the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP) to receive alerts. It makes it easier to locate you in an emergency.

In 2025, there were 2937 political violence events. Advisory Details: Updated to reflect inconsistent availability of health care services. Reconsider travel to Nigeria due to crime , terrorism , civil unrest , kidnapping , armed gangs, and inconsistent availability of health care services . Some places in Nigeria have an increased risk. Overall, all locations carry significant security risks. Read the entire Travel Advisory. Do Not Travel to : Borno, Yobe, Kogi, and northern Adamawa states due to terrorism and kidnapping Bauchi, Gombe, Kaduna, Kano, Katsina, Sokoto, and Zamfara states due to kidnapping Abia, Anambra, Bayelsa, Delta, Enugu, Imo, and Rivers states (with the exception of Port Harcourt) due to crime , kidnapping , and armed gangs. Country Summary : Violent crime is common in the country. This includes armed robbery, assault, carjacking, kidnapping, hostage-taking, roadside banditry, and rape. Kidnappings for ransom happen often. They primarily target dual national citizens visiting Nigeria and U.S. citizens perceived as wealthy. Kidnapping gangs have also stopped victims on interstate roads. Terrorism There is risk of terrorist violence in Nigeria. This includes terrorist attacks and other activities. Terrorists continue plotting and carrying out attacks in Nigeria. Terrorists collaborate with local gangs to expand their reach. They may attack with little or no warning, including: Shopping centers and malls Markets Hotels Places of worship Restaurants and bars Schools Government buildings Transportation hubs Public places where crowds gather Visit the U.S. Department of State's country reports on terrorism to learn more. Gangs and crime Civil unrest and armed gangs are active in parts of Southern Nigeria. This is especially true in the Niger Delta and Southeast regions. Armed crime and gangs are common in the area. Crimes include kidnapping and assaults on Nigerian security services. Violence can flare up between communities of farmers and herders in rural areas. Unreliable health care U.S. citizens should not expect the same level of health care to be available in Nigeria as they do in the United States: Nigerian medical facilities are generally not equipped to U.S. or European standards. Many medicines are not available. This includes common medications for diabetes or asthma. Bring enough over-the-counter and prescription medicines to last your entire stay in Nigeria. Update vaccinations to include all standard vaccinations, plus yellow fever, meningitis, typhoid, cholera, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and a polio booster. All visitors should take Malaria prophylaxis. Nigeria is high risk for Malaria. Counterfeit pharmaceuticals are a common problem. Hospitals often expect immediate cash payment for health services. Most hospitals and doctors do not accept U.S. health insurance. Emergency services like those in the United States or Europe do not exist. Blood supply is often unreliable. Ambulance services are unreliable, have poor equipment, and often do not have trained paramedics. We strongly recommend getting traveler’s insurance, including medical evacuation insurance, before traveling. The Department of State does not pay medical bills for U.S. citizens overseas. U.S. Medicare/Medicaid do not work overseas. Due to security risks, U.S. government employees cannot provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in many areas of Nigeria. Read the country information page for additional information on travel to Nigeria. If you decide to travel to Nigeria: Carry proper identification, including a U.S. passport with a current Nigerian visa, if needed. Use caution when walking or driving. Keep a low profile. Review travel routes and times. Vary your predictability. Do not physically resist any robbery attempt. Be extra vigilant when visiting banks or ATMs. Check local media for breaking events and be prepared to adjust your plans. Be aware of your surroundings. Stay alert in locations frequented by foreign tourists. Avoid demonstrations and large political gatherings. Review your personal security plans. Have evacuation plans that do not depend on U.S. government help. Establish a “proof of life” protocol with your loved ones, so that if you are taken hostage, your loved ones know specific questions (and answers) to ask the hostage-takers to be sure that you are alive. This helps to rule out scams. Enroll in the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP) to receive alerts. It makes it easier to locate you in an emergency. Get comprehensive medical insurance that includes medical evacuation. Review the Country Security Report for Nigeria. Prepare a backup plan for emergency situations. Review the Traveler’s Checklist.

These include: NGO workers, Academics and students, Business representatives, Civil society leaders, Religious and charity workers (including foreign missionaries), Journalists, And many others. In the past year, the Government of Nicaragua has subjected U.S. citizens to arbitrary entry and exit bans, expulsions, arrests, revocations of Nicaraguan citizenship, and other actions. The Government of Nicaragua may: Arbitrarily deny entry or re-entry to Nicaragua or departure from Nicaragua to U.S. citizens and Nicaraguan citizens. This includes entry by air or land. Travel refunds are NOT provided in these cases. Denials and exit bans can occur for political reasons. This includes perceived support for or association with those the government disfavors. The government is not required to provide a basis for its denial . Search personal phones, computers, social media accounts, and documents for anti-government content. Limit photography. Seize personal devices. Target individuals for political reasons, regardless of nationality.

The Department has determined there is a risk of wrongful detention of U.S. nationals by the Government of Nicaragua . U.S. citizens should reconsider travel to Nicaragua, including to work for or volunteer with non-profits or religious organizations. Since 2018, the Government of Nicaragua has closed more than 5,300 civil society organizations, including religious organizations. Nicaraguan security services have arrested U.S. citizens on false charges. This includes dual U.S.-Nicaraguan citizens. Those arrested can be denied fair and transparent treatment. Convictions routinely occur in non-public trials without adequate defense or credible evidence. Nicaraguan authorities also arbitrarily enforce laws against U.S. citizen religious workers. Nicaraguan authorities have conducted questionable criminal investigations against U.S. citizens engaged in religious activity. U.S. citizens arrested in Nicaragua may be detained for long periods without charges. Judicial processes often lack transparency. This is especially true in politically motivated arrests and property disputes. Political objectives and pressure may affect the willingness of a local attorney to assist and impact the outcomes of legal processes. Prison conditions can be harsh and life-threatening. Managua has a sole private hospital that is JCAHO (Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations) accredited and certified, with labs and radiology services available, though it has a very limited number of specialists for acute emergencies. Medical services outside Managua are limited, including for victims of crime. Government hospitals are understaffed and some hospitals throughout the country may not be able to assist in emergencies.

Terrorist attacks are frequent in Balochistan Province and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province (KP), which include the former FATA. Large-scale terrorist attacks have resulted in numerous casualties, and small-scale attacks are frequent. Terrorism and ongoing violence by extremist elements have led to indiscriminate attacks on civilian, as well as local military and police targets. Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, targeting transportation hubs, markets, shopping malls, military installations, airports, universities, tourist attractions, schools, hospitals, places of worship, and government facilities. Terrorists have targeted U.S. diplomats and diplomatic facilities in the past. Local law prohibits protesting or demonstrating without a permit.

The risk of harassment or wrongful detention by Russian security officials. The arbitrary enforcement of local laws. The possibility of terrorism. U.S. citizens in Russia should leave immediately. The U.S. government has limited ability to help U.S. citizens in Russia, especially outside of Moscow. The U.S. Embassy in Moscow has reduced its staff and the Russian government has restricted travel for embassy personnel. All U.S. consulates in Russia have suspended operations, including consular services. Do not travel to Russia for any reason. The U.S. Embassy in Moscow has limited ability to assist in the case of a detention of a U.S. citizen. There is no guarantee that a U.S. citizen will be afforded consular access or released before their entire prison sentence is served. The risk of wrongful detention of U.S. nationals remains high. Even if a case is determined wrongful, there is no guarantee of release. Russian officials have questioned and threatened U.S. citizens without reason. Russian security services have arrested U.S. citizens on false charges. They have denied them fair treatment and convicted them without credible evidence. Russian authorities have opened questionable investigations against U.S. citizens for their religious activities. There have been drone attacks and explosions near the border with Ukraine, and in Moscow, Kazan, St. Petersburg, and other large cities. In 2024, ISIS Khorasan claimed responsibility for the attack at Crocus Music Hall in Moscow that killed 130 people, as well as attacks in Dagestan targeting places of worship. In an emergency, you should follow instructions from local authorities and seek shelter. Dual citizenship Russia will not recognize your U.S. citizenship if you are a dual U.S.-Russian citizen or have a claim to Russian citizenship. Russia has blocked U.S. consular officers from visiting detained dual U.S.-Russian citizens. The Russian government has forced people with dual citizenship to join the military and has stopped them from leaving the country. In 2022, Russia started drafting citizens for the war in Ukraine. The military draft is ongoing. Demonstrations In Russia, peaceful assembly and freedom of speech are not protected rights. U.S. citizens should avoid protests and taking photos of security staff at these events. Russian authorities have arrested U.S. citizens who have joined protests. Russians and U.S. citizens have been detained for posts on social media. Electronic devices Reconsider bringing electronic devices into Russia. U.S. citizens should assume all electronic communications and devices in Russia are monitored by Russian security services. Russian security services have arrested U.S. citizens and other foreign nationals based on information found on electronic devices. This includes information that was created, transmitted, or stored while in another country. Debit and credit cards U.S. credit and debit cards no longer work in Russia. Due to sanctions, sending electronic money transfers from the United States to Russia is nearly impossible. Air travel There are few commercial air travel options available. It may not be easy to book flights on short notice. If you wish to leave Russia, you should make your own travel plans. The U.S. Embassy can only offer limited help to U.S. citizens trying to leave. Transportation options could become even more limited at any time. Click here for Information for U.S. Citizens Seeking to Depart Russia. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has downgraded Russia's air safety rating from Category 1 to Category 2 due to safety concerns . U.S. government personnel outside of Russia generally are not allowed to fly on Russian airlines due to safety concerns. Additionally, the FAA banned U.S. flights within certain areas of Russian airspace, by issuing a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM). This is due to risks to civil aviation operating within or in the vicinity of these certain areas. For more information U.S. citizens should consult the Federal Aviation Administration’s Prohibitions, Restrictions and Notices . Laws and special circumstances Russian officials have questioned, threatened, and detained U.S. citizens without reason. This includes both former and current U.S. government and military personnel, as well as private U.S. citizens. Russian authorities have a history of wrongfully detaining U.S. nationals and using them as bargaining chips. U.S. citizens may become victims of harassment, mistreatment, and extortion. Russian authorities do not always notify the U.S. Embassy about the detention of a U.S. citizen. They may delay or deny U.S. consular assistance. Russian security services target foreign nationals and international organizations considered “undesirable.” Russian law allows authorities to punish foreigners for treason. This includes working for organizations that Russia perceives as acting against Russian interests. Former and current U.S. government employees and contractors should pay special attention to this part of Russian law. Security There have been drone attacks and explosions near the border with Ukraine and in Moscow, Kazan, St. Petersburg, and other large cities. In an emergency, you should follow instructions from local authorities and seek shelter. Russia's war in Ukraine has destabilized security in southwestern Russia. In October 2022, the Russian government declared martial law in the following border areas with Ukraine: Bryansk, Kursk, Belgorod, Voronezh, Rostov, and Krasnodar. Under martial law, authorities can: Set curfews Seize property Restrict movement Detain foreigners Forcibly relocate residents Limit public gatherings Russian authorities have questioned, detained, and arrested people for “acting against Russia's interests.” Local authorities have targeted people for posting on social media or supporting \"anti-Russian\" groups. They have punished people for criticizing the government or military. LGB travelers The Russian government's current \"propaganda\" law bans discussion of LGB topics. The community has been labeled as extremist, and it is considered a crime to support the human rights of LGB people in Russia. Displaying certain symbols, including the rainbow flag, is a crime. Terrorism Terrorists continue to plan and carry out attacks in Russia. The March 2024 Crocus City Hall incident in Moscow proved terrorists can strike suddenly. U.S. government employees working in Russia are prohibited from traveling to the North Caucasus, including Chechnya and Mt. Elbrus. Russian annexation of territories The international community does not recognize Russia’s annexation of Crimea, Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhya. Russia staged its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, in part, from occupied Crimea. There is a heavy Russian military presence in these areas and intense fighting across these regions. Russian authorities have abused foreigners and locals. In particular, they have targeted people who they see as opposing Russia’s authority. The U.S. Embassy in Kyiv, Ukraine offers consular services to U.S. citizens in Crimea, Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhya. However, the ongoing war limits the Embassy's ability to help U.S. citizens in these areas. If you choose to disregard the Travel Advisory and decide to travel to Russia: The Department has determined that the risk of wrongful detention of U.S. nationals is significant. Be ready for the possibility of detention for an unknown amount of time, possibly without a clear reason, and without the ability to contact your embassy or anyone else for help. Prepare a will and designate appropriate insurance beneficiaries or power of attorney. Share important documents, login information, and points of contact with loved ones so that they can manage your affairs if you are unable to return as planned to the United States. Review this list of documents to prepare for your trip. Discuss a plan with loved ones regarding care and custody of children, pets, property, belongings, non-liquid assets (collections, artwork, etc.), funeral wishes, etc. Leave DNA samples with your medical provider in case it is necessary for your family to access them. Develop a communication plan with family, your employer or host organization. List how and when you'll confirm you're safe (text or call). Specify how often you will do this.

Russian authorities have opened questionable investigations against U.S. citizens for their religious activities. There have been drone attacks and explosions near the border with Ukraine, and in Moscow, Kazan, St. Petersburg, and other large cities. In 2024, ISIS Khorasan claimed responsibility for the attack at Crocus Music Hall in Moscow that killed 130 people, as well as attacks in Dagestan targeting places of worship. In an emergency, you should follow instructions from local authorities and seek shelter. Dual citizenship Russia will not recognize your U.S. citizenship if you are a dual U.S.-Russian citizen or have a claim to Russian citizenship. Russia has blocked U.S. consular officers from visiting detained dual U.S.-Russian citizens. The Russian government has forced people with dual citizenship to join the military and has stopped them from leaving the country. In 2022, Russia started drafting citizens for the war in Ukraine. The military draft is ongoing. Demonstrations In Russia, peaceful assembly and freedom of speech are not protected rights. U.S. citizens should avoid protests and taking photos of security staff at these events. Russian authorities have arrested U.S. citizens who have joined protests. Russians and U.S. citizens have been detained for posts on social media. Electronic devices Reconsider bringing electronic devices into Russia. U.S. citizens should assume all electronic communications and devices in Russia are monitored by Russian security services. Russian security services have arrested U.S. citizens and other foreign nationals based on information found on electronic devices. This includes information that was created, transmitted, or stored while in another country. Debit and credit cards U.S. credit and debit cards no longer work in Russia. Due to sanctions, sending electronic money transfers from the United States to Russia is nearly impossible. Air travel There are few commercial air travel options available. It may not be easy to book flights on short notice. If you wish to leave Russia, you should make your own travel plans. The U.S. Embassy can only offer limited help to U.S. citizens trying to leave. Transportation options could become even more limited at any time. Click here for Information for U.S. Citizens Seeking to Depart Russia. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has downgraded Russia's air safety rating from Category 1 to Category 2 due to safety concerns . U.S. government personnel outside of Russia generally are not allowed to fly on Russian airlines due to safety concerns. Additionally, the FAA banned U.S. flights within certain areas of Russian airspace, by issuing a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM). This is due to risks to civil aviation operating within or in the vicinity of these certain areas. For more information U.S. citizens should consult the Federal Aviation Administration’s Prohibitions, Restrictions and Notices . Laws and special circumstances Russian officials have questioned, threatened, and detained U.S. citizens without reason. This includes both former and current U.S. government and military personnel, as well as private U.S. citizens. Russian authorities have a history of wrongfully detaining U.S. nationals and using them as bargaining chips. U.S. citizens may become victims of harassment, mistreatment, and extortion. Russian authorities do not always notify the U.S. Embassy about the detention of a U.S. citizen. They may delay or deny U.S. consular assistance. Russian security services target foreign nationals and international organizations considered “undesirable.” Russian law allows authorities to punish foreigners for treason. This includes working for organizations that Russia perceives as acting against Russian interests. Former and current U.S. government employees and contractors should pay special attention to this part of Russian law. Security There have been drone attacks and explosions near the border with Ukraine and in Moscow, Kazan, St. Petersburg, and other large cities. In an emergency, you should follow instructions from local authorities and seek shelter. Russia's war in Ukraine has destabilized security in southwestern Russia. In October 2022, the Russian government declared martial law in the following border areas with Ukraine: Bryansk, Kursk, Belgorod, Voronezh, Rostov, and Krasnodar. Under martial law, authorities can: Set curfews Seize property Restrict movement Detain foreigners Forcibly relocate residents Limit public gatherings Russian authorities have questioned, detained, and arrested people for “acting against Russia's interests.” Local authorities have targeted people for posting on social media or supporting \"anti-Russian\" groups. They have punished people for criticizing the government or military. LGB travelers The Russian government's current \"propaganda\" law bans discussion of LGB topics. The community has been labeled as extremist, and it is considered a crime to support the human rights of LGB people in Russia. Displaying certain symbols, including the rainbow flag, is a crime. Terrorism Terrorists continue to plan and carry out attacks in Russia. The March 2024 Crocus City Hall incident in Moscow proved terrorists can strike suddenly. U.S. government employees working in Russia are prohibited from traveling to the North Caucasus, including Chechnya and Mt. Elbrus. Russian annexation of territories The international community does not recognize Russia’s annexation of Crimea, Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhya. Russia staged its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, in part, from occupied Crimea. There is a heavy Russian military presence in these areas and intense fighting across these regions. Russian authorities have abused foreigners and locals. In particular, they have targeted people who they see as opposing Russia’s authority. The U.S. Embassy in Kyiv, Ukraine offers consular services to U.S. citizens in Crimea, Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhya. However, the ongoing war limits the Embassy's ability to help U.S. citizens in these areas. If you choose to disregard the Travel Advisory and decide to travel to Russia: The Department has determined that the risk of wrongful detention of U.S. nationals is significant. Be ready for the possibility of detention for an unknown amount of time, possibly without a clear reason, and without the ability to contact your embassy or anyone else for help. Prepare a will and designate appropriate insurance beneficiaries or power of attorney. Share important documents, login information, and points of contact with loved ones so that they can manage your affairs if you are unable to return as planned to the United States.

Country Summary: Armed conflict is ongoing and includes fighting between various political and ethnic groups. Weapons are readily available to the population. In addition, cattle raids occur throughout the country and often lead to violence. Violent crime, such as carjackings, shootings, ambushes, assaults, robberies, and kidnappings are common throughout South Sudan, including Juba. Foreign nationals have been the victims of rape, sexual assault, armed robberies, and other violent crimes. Reporting in South Sudan without the proper documentation from the South Sudanese Media Authority is considered illegal, and any journalistic work there is very dangerous. Journalists regularly report being harassed in South Sudan, and many have been killed while covering the conflict. The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency consular services to U.S. citizens in South Sudan. U.S. government personnel working in South Sudan are under a strict curfew. They must use armored vehicles for nearly all movements, and official travel outside Juba is limited. Due to the critical crime threat in Juba, walking is also restricted; when allowed, it is limited to a small area in the immediate vicinity of the Embassy and during daylight hours only. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) and/or a Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR). This is due to risks to civil aviation operating within or in the vicinity of South Sudan. For more information U.S. citizens should consult the Federal Aviation Administration’s Prohibitions, Restrictions and Notices. Read the country information page for additional information on travel to South Sudan. If you decide to travel to South Sudan: Exercise extreme care in all parts of the country, including Juba.

The U.S. government is unable to provide any routine or emergency consular services to U.S. citizens in Syria. Do not travel to Syria for any reason. Syria has experienced active armed conflict since 2011. No part of Syria is safe from violence. Hostage taking by armed groups, terrorism, remnants of war such as unexploded ordnance, and aerial bombardment pose significant risk of death or serious injury. The destruction of infrastructure, housing, medical facilities, schools, and power and water utilities has also increased hardships inside the country. The U.S. government strongly warns private U.S. citizens against traveling to Syria to engage in armed conflict. The U.S. government does not support this activity. U.S. citizens who undertake such activity face extreme personal risks, including hostage taking by armed groups, injury, or death. There is risk of terrorist violence, including terrorist attacks and other activity in Syria. Visit the U.S. Department of State’s country reports on terrorism to learn more. Parts of Syria have experienced recent increases in incidents of bombings, improvised explosive devices (IEDs), and assassinations.

There is an ongoing risk of hostage taking of U.S. citizens and other foreign nationals throughout the country. In the past, U.S. citizens have been targets of abduction and detention in Syria. Those in detention may not have access to fair judicial process or medical attention. Current detention center conditions are unclear but could be harsh and unsanitary. Failure to obtain a legitimate entry visa directly from the Syrian government could result in detention. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) and a Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR) advising against travel to Syria due to risks to civil aviation operating within or in the vicinity of Syria.

    "advisory_text": "Reissued with updates after periodic review. Do not travel to Ukraine due to Russia’s war against Ukraine. The Department of State continues to advise U.S. citizens to not travel to frontline regions of Ukraine and areas along Ukraine’s border with Belarus due to presence of Russian and Belarusian military and security forces on the Belarusian side of the border, proximity to active ground combat, frequent shelling, missile and drone attacks on populated areas and civilian infrastructure, and limitations on the Embassy’s ability to provide assistance to U.S. citizens in those areas. Read the entire Travel Advisory. Some regions may have lower level of risk due to air defense capabilities and distance from active combat zones. Level 3: Reconsider Travel to the regions of Volyn, Lviv, Zakarpattia, Ivano-Frankivsk, Chernivtsi, Ternopil, Rivne, Khmelnytskyi and Zhytomyr. Russia’s unprovoked full-scale invasion of Ukraine continues, and even non-frontline regions remain subject to Russian missile and drone attacks. Travelers should react to air alerts and seek appropriate shelter. The security situation can change quickly, and travelers should be prepared to depart immediately with little to no warning. Closed airspace restricts travel options, and non-frontline regions are still subject to martial law restrictions, such as a nationwide curfew. U.S. government employees are subject to movement, curfew, and activity restrictions that may be more limited than Ukrainian government restrictions under martial law. All U.S. citizens should carefully monitor U.S. government notices and local and international media outlets for information about changing security conditions and alerts to shelter in place. The security situation in Ukraine remains unpredictable. U.S. citizens in Ukraine should stay vigilant and take appropriate steps to increase their security awareness in the event of military attacks. Download and turn on notifications for free mobile applications – which U.S. government personnel in Ukraine are required to have and monitor – that announce air alerts in real time, such as Air Raid Siren and Alarm Map . The U.S. Embassy does not have the ability to provide real-time alerts to the general U.S. citizen community of air threats. Know the location of your closest shelter at all times. In the event of mortar, missile, drone, or rocket fire, follow instructions from local authorities and seek shelter immediately. If you feel your current location is no longer safe, you should carefully assess the potential risks involved in moving to a different location. On February 24, 2022, the Ukrainian government declared a state of emergency. Each region (oblast) decides on measures to be implemented according to local conditions. Measures could include curfews, restrictions on the freedom of movement, ID verification, and increased security inspections, among other measures. Follow any oblast-specific state of emergency measures. Ukrainian law does not recognize dual nationality, and Ukraine will not recognize your U.S. citizenship if you are also a citizen of Ukraine. Dual citizens will be treated as Ukrainian citizens while in Ukraine and will be required to use a Ukrainian passport upon entry and exit of the country. Men aged 18-60 with Ukrainian citizenship are also subject to exit restrictions and possible mobilization during the period of martial law. The U.S. Embassy in Kyiv has received numerous reports of dual U.S.-Ukrainian citizens encountering significant difficulties both entering and exiting Ukraine. Travelers with family ties to Ukraine should consult the nearest Ukrainian Embassy or Consulate regarding potential citizenship obligations before entering Ukraine. For more information on traveling with dual nationality, please visit our Travelers with Dual Nationality page. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Air Missions (NOTAM) prohibiting U.S. aviation operations into, out of, within, or over Ukraine. For more information, U.S. citizens should consult the FAA’s Prohibitions, Restrictions, and Notices . U.S. citizens seeking assistance, including routine services, should email KyivACS@state.gov . Please review what the U.S. government can and cannot do to assist you in a crisis overseas . The Embassy is open and operating in Kyiv; however, Embassy personnel are subject to movement, curfew, and activity restrictions, which may cause delays in provision of consular assistance to U.S. citizens outside of Kyiv. Occupied Territories: Most of the international community, including the United States and Ukraine, do not recognize Russia’s purported annexation of Crimea in 2014, nor the September 2022 purported annexation of four other Ukrainian oblasts -- Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia. There is extensive Russian Federation military presence in many parts of these oblasts. There are also abuses against foreigners and the local population by the occupation authorities in these regions, particularly against those who are seen as challenging Russia’s occupation. There are instances of Russian forces and their proxies singling out U.S. citizens in Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine for detention, interrogation, or harassment because of their nationality. U.S. citizens have also been singled out when evacuating by land through Russia-occupied territory or to Russia or Belarus. Although Russia’s occupation severely restricts the Embassy’s access and ability to provide services in these areas, the Department of State and the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv continue to remotely provide certain emergency consular services to U.S. citizens in Crimea as well as four other Ukrainian oblasts partially occupied by Russia – Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia.

In 2025, there were 53769 political violence events. Advisory Details: Reissued with updates after periodic review. Do not travel to Ukraine due to Russia’s war against Ukraine. The Department of State continues to advise U.S. citizens to not travel to frontline regions of Ukraine and areas along Ukraine’s border with Belarus due to presence of Russian and Belarusian military and security forces on the Belarusian side of the border, proximity to active ground combat, frequent shelling, missile and drone attacks on populated areas and civilian infrastructure, and limitations on the Embassy’s ability to provide assistance to U.S. citizens in those areas. Read the entire Travel Advisory. Some regions may have lower level of risk due to air defense capabilities and distance from active combat zones. Level 3: Reconsider Travel to the regions of Volyn, Lviv, Zakarpattia, Ivano-Frankivsk, Chernivtsi, Ternopil, Rivne, Khmelnytskyi and Zhytomyr. Russia’s unprovoked full-scale invasion of Ukraine continues, and even non-frontline regions remain subject to Russian missile and drone attacks. Travelers should react to air alerts and seek appropriate shelter. The security situation can change quickly, and travelers should be prepared to depart immediately with little to no warning. Closed airspace restricts travel options, and non-frontline regions are still subject to martial law restrictions, such as a nationwide curfew. U.S. government employees are subject to movement, curfew, and activity restrictions that may be more limited than Ukrainian government restrictions under martial law. All U.S. citizens should carefully monitor U.S. government notices and local and international media outlets for information about changing security conditions and alerts to shelter in place. The security situation in Ukraine remains unpredictable. U.S. citizens in Ukraine should stay vigilant and take appropriate steps to increase their security awareness in the event of military attacks. Download and turn on notifications for free mobile applications – which U.S. government personnel in Ukraine are required to have and monitor – that announce air alerts in real time, such as Air Raid Siren and Alarm Map . The U.S. Embassy does not have the ability to provide real-time alerts to the general U.S. citizen community of air threats. Know the location of your closest shelter at all times. In the event of mortar, missile, drone, or rocket fire, follow instructions from local authorities and seek shelter immediately. If you feel your current location is no longer safe, you should carefully assess the potential risks involved in moving to a different location. On February 24, 2022, the Ukrainian government declared a state of emergency. Each region (oblast) decides on measures to be implemented according to local conditions. Measures could include curfews, restrictions on the freedom of movement, ID verification, and increased security inspections, among other measures. Follow any oblast-specific state of emergency measures. Ukrainian law does not recognize dual nationality, and Ukraine will not recognize your U.S. citizenship if you are also a citizen of Ukraine. Dual citizens will be treated as Ukrainian citizens while in Ukraine and will be required to use a Ukrainian passport upon entry and exit of the country. Men aged 18-60 with Ukrainian citizenship are also subject to exit restrictions and possible mobilization during the period of martial law. The U.S. Embassy in Kyiv has received numerous reports of dual U.S.-Ukrainian citizens encountering significant difficulties both entering and exiting Ukraine. Travelers with family ties to Ukraine should consult the nearest Ukrainian Embassy or Consulate regarding potential citizenship obligations before entering Ukraine. For more information on traveling with dual nationality, please visit our Travelers with Dual Nationality page. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Air Missions (NOTAM) prohibiting U.S. aviation operations into, out of, within, or over Ukraine. For more information, U.S. citizens should consult the FAA’s Prohibitions, Restrictions, and Notices . U.S. citizens seeking assistance, including routine services, should email KyivACS@state.gov . Please review what the U.S. government can and cannot do to assist you in a crisis overseas . The Embassy is open and operating in Kyiv; however, Embassy personnel are subject to movement, curfew, and activity restrictions, which may cause delays in provision of consular assistance to U.S. citizens outside of Kyiv. Occupied Territories: Most of the international community, including the United States and Ukraine, do not recognize Russia’s purported annexation of Crimea in 2014, nor the September 2022 purported annexation of four other Ukrainian oblasts -- Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia. There is extensive Russian Federation military presence in many parts of these oblasts. There are also abuses against foreigners and the local population by the occupation authorities in these regions, particularly against those who are seen as challenging Russia’s occupation. There are instances of Russian forces and their proxies singling out U.S. citizens in Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine for detention, interrogation, or harassment because of their nationality. U.S. citizens have also been singled out when evacuating by land through Russia-occupied territory or to Russia or Belarus. Although Russia’s occupation severely restricts the Embassy’s access and ability to provide services in these areas, the Department of State and the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv continue to remotely provide certain emergency consular services to U.S. citizens in Crimea as well as four other Ukrainian oblasts partially occupied by Russia – Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia.

Do not travel to Yemen due to terrorism, civil unrest, crime, health risks, kidnapping, armed conflict, and landmines . Country Summary: The U.S. Embassy in Sana’a suspended its operations in February 2015. The U.S. government is unable to provide emergency or routine consular services to U.S. citizens in Yemen. U.S. citizens should not travel to Yemen for any reason. The Department of State has re-designated Ansarallah (commonly referred to as the Houthis) as a Foreign Terrorist Organization. Other terrorist groups, like Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and Islamic State affiliates, also plan and carry out attacks in Yemen. Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, targeting public sites, transportation hubs, markets, as well as government buildings and facilities. There is also a risk of kidnapping/detention by terrorists, criminals, and other groups or individuals. Foreign workers and employees may be targeted. A civil war continues in Yemen. Even though violence has decreased since a truce in April 2022, instability and fighting are still common, especially along the front lines in central Yemen. Travelers should not rely on significant assistance from local authorities. Foreigners are frequently targets of kidnapping and carjacking, especially outside of urban areas. Military conflict has destroyed basic infrastructure like housing, medical facilities, schools, and utilities. This makes it hard to get electricity, clean water, and medical care. Humanitarian groups face obstacles in delivering food, medicine, and water. Landmines are found throughout Yemen. Violent and organized crime is common in Yemen. Local law enforcement may not be able or willing to respond to serious crimes. Health services in Yemen are poor. There is a re-emergence of diseases like cholera, polio, and measles, which are spreading, especially in Houthi-controlled areas. Medicine and medical supplies are hard to find. Adequate medical treatment is often not available. U.S. citizens, especially dual U.S.-Yemeni citizens, are at high risk of kidnapping and detention in Yemen. U.S. citizens, particularly young people, may be kidnapped for forced marriage. These often involve family members in the United States and/or Yemen. The Houthis, who control Sana’a, have detained U.S. citizens, including those with dual citizenship. U.S. citizens have faced difficulty and delays when trying to leave Yemen. Some companies outside Yemen have misrepresented the safety of the Yemeni island of Socotra. They offer tourist trips with unofficial and invalid \"visas.\" These companies put tourists in danger and legal jeopardy. Only the Republic of Yemen government can issue valid Yemeni visas. The U.S. government cannot assist U.S. citizens in Socotra. Do not travel to Socotra or any part of Yemen. Limited commercial flights are available from Aden and Sana’a to other airports in the region. Check with airlines and travel companies for the latest flight information. Due to risks to civil aviation operating within or in the vicinity of Yemen, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) and a Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR). For more information, U.S. citizens should consult the Federal Aviation Administration’s Prohibitions, Restrictions, and Notices . Due to risks to commercial shipping operating within or in the vicinity of Yemen territorial waters, the Department of Transportation’s Maritime Administration (MARAD) has issued a Maritime Advisory. For more information, U.S. citizens should consult the Maritime Administration’s Maritime Security Communications with Industry (MSCI) . The U.S. Coast Guard has determined that effective anti-terrorism measures are not in place in Yemen ports and has imposed conditions of entry on vessels that arrive in U.S. ports having visited ports in Yemen. Mariners and passengers traveling through the ports of Yemen should exercise caution. Read the country information page for additional information on travel to Yemen. If, despite this Travel Advisory, you decide to travel to Yemen: Visit our website for Travel to High-Risk Areas . Bring enough supply of over-the-counter and prescription medicines. Have evacuation plans that do not rely on U.S. government assistance. Draft a will and designate appropriate insurance beneficiaries or power of attorney. Make a plan with loved ones regarding care/custody of children, pets, property, belongings, non-liquid assets (collections, artwork, etc.), funeral wishes, etc. Share important documents, login information, and points of contact with loved ones. This is so that they can manage your affairs if you are unable to return as planned to the United States. Review this list of documents to prepare for your trip. Stay aware of your surroundings. Consider hiring a professional security organization. Develop a communication plan with family, or your employer or host organization (if you are traveling on business). This is so that they can monitor your safety and location as you travel through high-risk areas. Specify how you’ll confirm you’re safe (texts, calls, etc.), how often, and who you’ll contact first to share the information. Appoint one family member to serve as the point of contact if you are taken hostage or detained. Set up a proof-of-life protocol. If you become a hostage, that person will know what questions to ask and answers to expect. This will help them be sure that you are alive (and to rule out a hoax). Leave DNA samples with your medical provider in case it is necessary for your family to access them.
