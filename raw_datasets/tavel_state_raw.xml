      <title>Belarus - Level 4: Do Not Travel</title>
      <link>https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/belarus-travel-advisory.html</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 28 Aug 2025</pubDate>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><b>Do not travel to Belarus due to:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The risk of harassment by Belarusian security officials.</li>
<li>The arbitrary enforcement of local laws.</li>
<li>The potential for civil unrest.</li>
<li>Danger associated with its continued support of Russia&#8217;s war against Ukraine.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Ordered Departure<br>
</b>On February 28, 2022, the Department of State ordered the departure of U.S. government employees and the suspension of operations at U.S. Embassy Minsk.&#8239;&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>All consular services, routine and emergency, are suspended until further notice.</b>&#8239;The U.S. government has severely limited ability to help U.S. citizens in Belarus. U.S. citizens in Belarus who require consular services should leave the country immediately and contact a U.S. embassy or consulate in another country.</p>
<p><b>Advisory Summary:<br>
</b>The U.S. government has extremely limited ability to assist detained U.S. citizens. A U.S. citizen may not receive consular access and could face extended periods of detention with no contact with the outside world.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Dual Citizenship<br>
</b>Belarus does not recognize dual nationality. Belarus will not recognize your U.S. citizenship if you are a dual U.S.-Belarusian citizen or have a claim to Belarusian citizenship.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Belarus repeatedly has blocked U.S. consular officers from visiting detained dual U.S.-Belarusian citizens.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The Belarusian government has prevented dual U.S.-Belarusian citizens from leaving the country, and in some cases forced dual citizens into mandatory military service.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Demonstrations<br>
</b>In Belarus, peaceful assembly and freedom of speech are not protected rights. U.S. citizens should avoid demonstrations.&#8239;Belarusian authorities have used excessive force to disperse demonstrators, including people peacefully demonstrating.&nbsp; Bystanders, including foreign nationals,&#8239;face the possibility of arrest or detention.</p>
<p>U.S. citizens near demonstrations have been arrested. Some have been victims of harassment or mistreatment by Belarusian officials.&nbsp; Belarusian officials unevenly enforce laws and regulations. Belarusian authorities have targeted individuals associated with independent and foreign media.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Belarusian authorities have detained tens of thousands of individuals, including U.S. citizens, accused of links to opposition parties and involvement in political protests, even if these links or associated activities occurred outside Belarus.&nbsp;</p>
<p>About 1,100 prisoners are currently in prison or otherwise detained for political activities that may not be considered crimes in the United States.&nbsp; The Belarusian authorities have denied prisoners access to their embassy and lawyers, as well as restricted communication with family outside prison Conditions in Belarusian detention facilities are extremely poor and there are credible accounts of prisoners being mistreated and abused while in custody.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Electronic devices<br>
</b>Reconsider bringing electronic devices into Belarus. U.S. citizens should assume all electronic communications and devices in Belarus are monitored by Belarusian security services. Belarusian security services have arrested U.S. citizens and other foreign nationals based on information found on electronic devices, including information that was created, transmitted, or stored while in another country.</p>
<p><b>Air Travel<br>
</b>There are few commercial air travel options available into and out of Belarus. Flights could be unavailable on short notice, and the availability of other transportation options could change at any time. Those wishing to leave Belarus should make their own travel plans. The U.S. government can only offer limited help to U.S. citizens trying to leave.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Border crossings with neighboring states sometimes close with little notice. U.S. citizens should regularly reevaluate departure plans in the event of an emergency.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On May 23, 2021, Belarusian authorities improperly forced the landing of a commercial plane transiting through Belarusian airspace in order to arrest an opposition journalist who was a passenger.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>On February 24, 2022, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued an ongoing Advisory Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) banning U.S. air carriers and commercial operators, U.S. pilots, and U.S. registered aircraft from operating in the Minsk Flight Information Region (UMMV) due to safety-of-flight risks associated with ongoing hostilities.&nbsp; The&#8239;<a href="https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions">Federal Aviation Administration&#8217;s Prohibitions, Restrictions and Notices includes more information.</a></p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><b><i>Updated due to changes to the Travel Advisory level, U.S. government restrictions on personnel, and information on armed conflict in North and South Kivu.</i></b></p>
<p>Reconsider travel to the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) due to<b>&nbsp;crime</b>, and<b> civil unrest</b>. Some areas have increased risk due to armed conflict. Read the entire Travel Advisory.</p>
<p><b>Do Not Travel To:</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>North and South Kivu provinces</b> due to&nbsp;<b>crime</b>,<b> terrorism</b>,<b> civil unrest</b>,&nbsp;<b>armed conflict</b>, and&nbsp;<b>kidnapping</b>.<b></b></li>
<li><b>Ituri province</b> due to&nbsp;<b>crime</b>,&nbsp;<b>civil unrest</b>,&nbsp;<b>terrorism</b>,&nbsp;<b>armed</b>&nbsp;<b>conflict</b>, and&nbsp;<b>kidnapping</b>.</li>

<li><b>Mai-Ndombe province</b> due to <b>ethnic/communal violence</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Country Summary:&nbsp;</b>Violent crime is common. This includes armed robbery, armed home invasion, and assault. Local police lack the resources to respond to serious crime in a timely and adequate manner. Assailants may pose as police or security agents. DRC law enforcement does not always inform the U.S. embassy when they arrest a U.S. citizen. They may also delay access to detained or charged U.S. citizens. DRC law enforcement has used violence and threats during interrogations.</p>
<p>Demonstrations are common in many cities, and some have turned violent. Police may respond with force, resulting in deaths and arrests. Looting, assault, traffic obstruction, property damage, and other violent actions occur when police don't respond in a timely manner, or at all.</p>
<p>The U.S. government cannot provide emergency consular services to U.S. citizens outside of Kinshasa due to poor infrastructure and security risks. Due to the risks in the country, minor dependents cannot accompany U.S. government employees who work in the DRC.</p>

Seventeen districts in these provinces remain under a declared state of emergency due to ongoing violent conflict. There is a collateral risk of violence for U.S. citizens in Thailand&#8217;s southernmost provinces due to low intensity conflict.</p>
<p>The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in these provinces as U.S government employees must obtain special authorization to travel to these provinces.</p>
<p><b>Level 4 - Do Not Travel<br>

<p>Do not travel to areas within 50km of the Thai-Cambodian border due to <b>ongoing fighting </b>between Thai and Cambodian military forces.<br>
<br>
There are reports of fighting, including rocket and artillery fire, between Cambodian and Thai forces along the border.&nbsp; Armed conflict has led to civilian casualties, and the Thai government has ordered the evacuation of certain areas. There is a collateral risk of violence, and U.S. citizens are advised to avoid all but essential travel to within 50km of these border areas until further notice.&nbsp; The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in these provinces due to the ongoing risk of armed conflict.</p>

      <title>Syria - Level 4: Do Not Travel</title>
      <link>https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/syria-travel-advisory.html</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 23 Jul 2025</pubDate>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><b><i>Updated to reflect recent developments in Syria. </i></b></p>
<p>Do not travel to Syria due to the risk of&nbsp;<b>terrorism, civil unrest, kidnapping, hostage taking, and armed conflict</b>.<b> </b></p>
<p><b>Country Summary:</b>&#8239;The U.S. government suspended operations of the U.S. Embassy in 2012. Czechia serves as the protecting power for the United States in Syria. The U.S. government is unable to provide any routine or emergency consular services to U.S. citizens in Syria. <b>Do not travel to Syria for any reason.</b></p>
<p>Syria has experienced active armed conflict since 2011. No part of Syria is safe from violence. Hostage taking by armed groups, terrorism, remnants of war such as unexploded ordnance, and aerial bombardment pose significant risk of death or serious injury. The destruction of infrastructure, housing, medical facilities, schools, and power and water utilities has also increased hardships inside the country.</p>
<p>The U.S. government strongly warns private U.S. citizens against traveling to Syria to engage in armed conflict. The U.S. government does not support this activity. U.S. citizens who undertake such activity face extreme personal risks, including hostage taking by armed groups, injury, or death.</p>
<p>&nbsp;There is risk of terrorist violence, including terrorist attacks and other activity in Syria. Visit the U.S. Department of State&#8217;s <a href="https://www.state.gov/country-reports-on-terrorism/">country reports on terrorism</a> to learn more. Parts of Syria have experienced recent increases in incidents of bombings, improvised explosive devices (IEDs), and assassinations. Providing material support or resources to designated foreign terrorist organizations, including ISIS and al-Qa&#8217;ida (AQ) affiliates, is a <b>crime under U.S. law</b> that can result in penalties including prison time and large fines.</p>
<p>There is an ongoing risk of hostage taking of U.S. citizens and other foreign nationals throughout the country. In the past, U.S. citizens have been targets of abduction and detention in Syria. Those in detention may not have access to fair judicial process or medical attention. Current detention center conditions are unclear but could be harsh and unsanitary. Failure to obtain a legitimate entry visa directly from the Syrian government could result in detention.</p>
<p>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) and a Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR) advising against travel to Syria due to risks to civil aviation operating within or in the vicinity of Syria. For more information, U.S. citizens should consult the <a href="https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions/">Federal Aviation Administration&#8217;s Prohibitions, Restrictions and Notices</a>. Read the&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/SyrianArabRepublic.html">country information page</a>&nbsp;for additional information on Syria, including alerts related to the closure of airspace.</p>
<p><b>If despite this warning, you decide to travel to Syria:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Visit our website on&#8239;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/high-risk-travelers.html">Travel to High Risk Areas</a>.</li>
<li>Draft a will and designate appropriate insurance beneficiaries or power of attorney.</li>
<li>Familiarize yourself with and respect local laws and customs. Foreign travelers may face increased risk of detention and harassment.</li>
<li>Establish a proof of life protocol with your loved ones. This is so that if you are taken hostage, your loved ones know specific questions (and answers) to ask the hostage-takers to be sure that you are alive (and to rule out a hoax).</li>
<li>Leave DNA samples with your medical provider in case it is necessary for your loved ones to access them.</li>
<li>Share important documents, login information, and points of contact with loved ones. This is so they can manage your affairs if you are unable to return as planned to the United States. Review thoroughly this <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-checklist.html">list</a> of documents to prepare for your trip.</li>
<li>Check local media for breaking events. Be prepared to adjust your plans.</li>
<li>Develop a communication plan with family or your employer or host organization (if you are traveling on business). This is so they can monitor your safety and location as you travel through high-risk areas. Specify how you will confirm you&#8217;re safe (texts, calls, etc.), how often, and whom you will contact first to share the information.</li>
<li>Avoid demonstrations and crowds.</li>
<li>Keep travel documents up to date and easily accessible.</li>
<li>Have evacuation plans that do not rely on U.S. government assistance.</li>
<li>Make backup plans to leave the country.</li>
<li>Enroll in <a href="https://step.state.gov/step/">Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP)</a>&nbsp;to receive messages and Alerts.</li>

      <title>Iraq - Level 4: Do Not Travel</title>
      <link>https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/iraq-travel-advisory.html</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 17 Jul 2025</pubDate>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><b><i>Updated to reflect the lifting of ordered departure of non-emergency U.S. government personnel.</i></b></p>
<p>Do not travel to Iraq due to <b>terrorism, kidnapping, armed conflict, civil unrest, and the U.S. government&#8217;s limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in Iraq. Do not travel to Iraq for any reason.</b></p>
<p><b>Country Summary:</b>&nbsp;U.S. citizens in Iraq face high risks, including violence and kidnapping. Terrorist and insurgent groups regularly attack Iraqi security forces and civilians. Anti-U.S. militias threaten U.S. citizens and international companies. Attacks using improvised explosive devices, indirect fire, and unmanned aerial vehicles occur in many areas, including major cities. The Department of State requires U.S. government personnel in Iraq to live and work under strict security due to serious threats.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is risk of terrorist violence, including terrorist attacks and other activity in Iraq. Visit the U.S. Department of State&#8217;s <a href="https://www.state.gov/country-reports-on-terrorism/">country reports on terrorism</a> to learn more.</p>
<p>Demonstrations, protests, and strikes occur frequently throughout the country. These events can develop quickly without prior notice, often interrupting traffic, transportation, and other services, and sometimes turn violent.</p>
<p>Do not travel near armed groups or Iraq&#8217;s northern borders due to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Continued threat of attacks by terrorist groups</li>
<li>Armed conflict</li>
<li>Aerial bombardment</li>
<li>Civil unrest</li>
</ul>
<p>U.S. citizens should not travel through Iraq to engage in armed conflict in Syria, where they would face extreme personal risks (kidnapping, injury, or death) and legal risks (arrest, fines, and expulsion). The Kurdistan Regional Government in Iraq has stated it will impose prison sentences of up to ten years on individuals who illegally cross the Iraq-Syria border. Fighting on behalf of or providing other forms of support to designated terrorist organizations can constitute the provision of material support to a foreign terrorist organization, which is a crime under U.S. law that can result in penalties including prison time and large fines. Read the <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/syria-travel-advisory.html">Syria Travel Advisory</a> for more information.</p>
<p>Because of security concerns, U.S. government personnel in Baghdad are prohibited from using Baghdad International Airport.</p>
<p>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) and a Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR) due to risks to civil aviation operating within or in the vicinity of Iraq. For more information, U.S. citizens should consult the <a href="https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions#Iraq">Federal Aviation Administration&#8217;s Prohibitions, Restrictions, and Notices.</a></p>

<p>If you decide to travel to Iraq:</p>
<ul>
<li>Establish a personal security plan in coordination with your employer or host organization or consider consulting with a professional security organization.</li>
<li>Draft a will and designate appropriate insurance beneficiaries and/or power of attorney.</li>
<li>Leave DNA samples with your medical provider in case it is necessary for your family to access them for identification purposes.</li>
<li>Have departure plans that do not rely on U.S. government assistance.</li>
<li>Discuss a plan with loved ones regarding care/custody of children, pets, property, belongings, non-liquid assets (collections, artwork, etc.), funeral wishes, etc.</li>

      <title>Libya - Level 4: Do Not Travel</title>
      <link>https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/libya-travel-advisory.html</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 16 Jul 2025</pubDate>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><i><b>Reissued after periodic review with minor edits.</b></i></p>
<p>Do not travel to Libya for any reason due to <b>crime</b>, <b>terrorism</b>, <b>unexploded landmines</b>, <b>civil unrest</b>, <b>kidnapping</b>, and <b>armed conflict</b>. Read entire Travel Advisory.</p>
<p><b>Country Summary</b>:&nbsp;Terrorism:&nbsp; There is risk of terrorist violence, including terrorist attacks and other activity in Libya. Visit the U.S. Department of State's <a href="https://www.state.gov/reports/country-reports-on-terrorism-2023/libya/">country reports on terrorism</a> to learn more. Terrorist attacks could occur with little or no warning, targeting public spaces like tourist locations, hotels, transportation hubs, markets/shopping malls, and government facilities.</p>
<p>Kidnapping is widespread, and victims have included U.S. citizens.</p>
<p>Kidnappers may take advantage of unplanned opportunities. Criminal or armed individuals or groups have threatened to and/or have seized or detained and threatened to kill, injure, or continue to detain individuals in order to compel a third party (including a governmental organization) to do or abstain from doing something as a condition of release.</p>
<p>Unexploded landmines, cluster munitions, and unexploded ammunition are a hazard throughout Libya. Heed land mine warning signs. Do not venture off the road into areas marked with red and white plastic tape. &nbsp;Avoid roadside ditches, shoulders, and unmarked trails. Never touch anything resembling unexploded munitions. Landmines do exist in populated areas due to numerous ground offensives in the last decade.</p>
<p>Outbreaks of violence between competing armed groups can occur with little warning and have the potential to impact U.S. citizens. The capital, Tripoli, and other cities, such as Surman, Al-Jufra, Misrata, Ajdabiya, Benghazi, and Zuwara, have witnessed fighting among armed groups. &nbsp;Hotels and airports frequented by U.S. citizens have been the targets of these attacks. Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and escalate into violence.</p>
<p>Armed groups sometimes detain travelers for arbitrary reasons, do not grant detainees access to lawyers or legal processes, and do not allow detainees to inform others of their status. U.S. citizens should carry proof of citizenship and valid immigration status at all times, but having these documents does not guarantee fair treatment.</p>
<p>While there are operational international airports in Libya with regular domestic and international flights, flights are often delayed, rerouted, and cancelled without warning. The U.S. government prohibits U.S. commercial aviation operations within Libyan airspace.</p>
<p>Due to risks to civil aviation operating within or in the vicinity of Libya, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Air Missions (NOTAM) and a Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR). For more information U.S. citizens should consult the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions/">Federal Aviation Administration&#8217;s Prohibitions, Restrictions and Notices</a>.</p>
<p>The Commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard has determined that effective anti-terrorism measures are not in place in Libyan ports and has imposed conditions of entry on vessels that arrive in U.S. ports having visited ports in Libya. Mariners and passengers traveling through the ports of Libya should exercise caution.</p>
<p>U.S. citizens in Libya in need of routine consular services should contact the U.S. Embassy in Tunis, Tunisia for assistance. To contact the U.S. Embassy in Tunis, <a href="https://tn.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/">click here</a>.</p>
<p>U.S. citizens who are in Libya are urged to depart as soon as possible via commercial means if possible. </p>
<p>The Department of State will continue to provide information via the <a href="https://mytravel.state.gov/s/step">Smart Traveler Enrollment Program</a> (STEP), <a href="https://ly.usembassy.gov/">Embassy Libya's web page</a>, <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel.html">Travel.State.Gov</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/travelgov/">Facebook</a>, and <a href="https://x.com/TravelGov">X</a>.</p>

<p>Reconsider travel to Nigeria due to&nbsp;<b>crime</b>,&nbsp;<b>terrorism</b>,&nbsp;<b>civil unrest</b>,&nbsp;<b>kidnapping</b>, <b>armed gangs, and inconsistent availability of health care services</b>.<b>&nbsp;</b>Some places in Nigeria have an increased risk. Overall, all locations carry significant security risks. Read the entire Travel Advisory.</p>
<p><b>Do Not Travel to</b>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Borno, Yobe, Kogi, and northern Adamawa states due to&nbsp;<b>terrorism</b>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<b>kidnapping</b></li>
<li>Bauchi, Gombe, Kaduna, Kano, Katsina, Sokoto, and Zamfara states due to&nbsp;<b>kidnapping</b></li>
<li>Abia, Anambra, Bayelsa, Delta, Enugu, Imo, and Rivers states (with the exception of Port Harcourt) due to&nbsp;<b>crime</b>,&nbsp;<b>kidnapping</b>, and&nbsp;<b>armed gangs.</b></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Country Summary</b>:&nbsp;<br>
Violent crime is common in the country. This includes armed robbery, assault, carjacking, kidnapping, hostage-taking, roadside banditry, and rape. Kidnappings for ransom happen often. They primarily target dual national citizens visiting Nigeria and U.S. citizens perceived as wealthy. Kidnapping gangs have also stopped victims on interstate roads.</p>
<p><b>Terrorism</b></p>
<p>There is risk of <b>terrorist violence</b> in Nigeria. This includes terrorist attacks and other activities.</p>
<p>Terrorists continue plotting and carrying out attacks in Nigeria. Terrorists collaborate with local gangs to expand their reach. They may attack with little or no warning, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shopping centers and malls</li>
<li>Markets</li>
<li>Hotels</li>
<li>Places of worship</li>
<li>Restaurants and bars</li>
<li>Schools</li>
<li>Government buildings</li>
<li>Transportation hubs</li>
<li>Public places where crowds gather</li>
</ul>
<p>Visit the U.S. Department of State's <a href="https://www.state.gov/country-reports-on-terrorism-2/">country reports on terrorism</a> to learn more.</p>
<p><b>Gangs and crime</b></p>
<p>Civil unrest and armed gangs are active in parts of Southern Nigeria. This is especially true in the Niger Delta and Southeast regions. Armed crime and gangs are common in the area. Crimes include <b>kidnapping </b>and <b>assaults</b> on Nigerian security services.</p>
<p>Violence can flare up between communities of farmers and herders in rural areas.</p>
<p><b>Unreliable health care</b></p>
<p>U.S. citizens should not expect the same level of health care to be available in Nigeria as they do in the United States:<b></b></p>
<ul>
<li>Nigerian medical facilities are generally not equipped to U.S. or European standards.</li>
<li>Many medicines are not available. This includes common medications for diabetes or asthma.</li>
<li>Bring enough over-the-counter and prescription medicines to last your entire stay in Nigeria.</li>
<li>Update <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/nigeria">vaccinations</a> to include all standard vaccinations, plus yellow fever, meningitis, typhoid, cholera, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and a polio booster.</li>
<li>All visitors should take Malaria prophylaxis. Nigeria is high risk for Malaria.</li>
<li>Counterfeit pharmaceuticals are a common problem.</li>
<li>Hospitals often expect immediate cash payment for health services.</li>
<li>Most hospitals and doctors do not accept U.S. health insurance.</li>
<li>Emergency services like those in the United States or Europe do not exist.</li>
<li>Blood supply is often unreliable.</li>
<li>Ambulance services are unreliable, have poor equipment, and often do not have trained paramedics.</li>
<li>We strongly recommend getting traveler&#8217;s insurance, including medical evacuation insurance, before traveling.</li>
<li>The Department of State does not pay medical bills for U.S. citizens overseas.</li>
<li><b>U.S. Medicare/Medicaid do not work overseas.</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Due to security risks, U.S. government employees cannot provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in many areas of Nigeria.</p>
<p>Read the&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Nigeria.html">country information page</a>&nbsp;for additional information on travel to Nigeria.</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;If you decide to travel to Nigeria:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Carry proper identification, including a U.S. passport with a current Nigerian visa, if needed.</li>
<li>Use caution when walking or driving.</li>
<li>Keep a low profile.</li>
<li>Review travel routes and times. Vary your predictability.</li>
<li>Do not physically resist any robbery attempt.</li>
<li>Be extra vigilant when visiting banks or ATMs.</li>
<li>Check local media for breaking events and be prepared to adjust your plans.</li>
<li>Be aware of your surroundings.</li>
<li>Stay alert in locations frequented by foreign tourists.</li>
<li>Avoid demonstrations and large political gatherings.</li>
<li>Review your personal security plans.</li>
<li>Have evacuation plans that do not depend on U.S. government help.</li>
<li>Establish a &#8220;proof of life&#8221; protocol with your loved ones, so that if you are taken hostage, your loved ones know specific questions (and answers) to ask the hostage-takers to be sure that you are alive. This helps to rule out scams.</li>
<li>Enroll in the&nbsp;<a href="https://step.state.gov/step/">Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP)</a>&nbsp;to receive alerts. It makes it easier to locate you in an emergency.</li>
<li>Get comprehensive medical insurance that includes medical evacuation.</li>

      <title>Haiti - Level 4: Do Not Travel</title>
      <link>https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/haiti-travel-advisory.html</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 15 Jul 2025</pubDate>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><b>Reissued after addition of terrorism indicator.</b></p>
<p>Do not travel to Haiti due to <b>kidnapping</b>, <b>crime</b>, <b>terrorist activity, civil unrest</b>, and <b>limited health care</b>. Read the entire Travel Advisory.</p>
<p><b>Country Summary: </b>In July 2023, the Department of State ordered nonemergency U.S. government employees and their family members to leave the country due to security risks.</p>
<p>Haiti has been under a State of Emergency since March 2024. Crimes involving firearms are common in Haiti. They include robbery, carjackings, sexual assault, and kidnappings for ransom. Do not travel to Haiti for any reason.</p>
<p><b>Kidnapping</b></p>
<p>Kidnapping is widespread. U.S. citizens have been victims and have been hurt or killed. Kidnappers may:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plan with precision or target victims during unexpected times.</li>
<li>Target and attack convoys.</li>
<li>Demand ransoms. U.S. victims&#8217; families have paid tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars to rescue their family members.&#8239;</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Demonstrations</b></p>
<p>Protests, demonstrations, and roadblocks are common and unpredictable. They often damage or destroy infrastructure and can become violent. Mob killings and public assaults are on the rise. People are targeting those they think have committed crimes.</p>
<p><b>Toussaint Louverture </b>I<b>nternational Airport</b></p>
<p>Exchanges of gunfire with criminal gangs, organized crime, and terrorists have occurred in the neighborhood just outside the Port-au-Prince International Airport (PAP). Travelers are sometimes followed and violently attacked and robbed shortly after leaving the airport, or while entering or leaving hotels in Port-au-Prince. U.S. commercial flights do not currently operate to and from Port-au-Prince. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) prohibiting U.S. air carrier flights to Port-au-Prince due to the ongoing instability. Please check FAA's&nbsp;<a href="https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions">website</a> for more information.</p>
<p><b>Crime and Terrorism</b></p>
<p>There is widespread violent crime and organized crime in the country, and local law enforcement has limited ability to respond to serious crimes. Violent crime is rampant in Haiti, especially in Port-au-Prince, where the expansion of gang, organized crime, and terrorist activity has led to widespread violence, kidnappings, and sexual assault. The escalation of clashes between armed groups has led to a rise in sporadic gunfire incidents. There is a substantial risk of being struck by stray bullets, even for individuals not directly involved in the violence.</p>
<p>There is risk of terrorist violence, including attacks and other violent gang activity in Haiti. There are gangs that are designated as terrorist organizations present in Haiti.</p>
<p><b>Transportation and Travel</b></p>
<p>Do not cross the border by land between Haiti and the Dominican Republic. There is a risk of kidnapping and violence. These dangers are present on roads from major Haitian cities to the border. The U.S. Embassy cannot help you enter the Dominican Republic by air, land, or sea.&#8239;U.S. citizens who cross into the Dominican Republic at an unofficial crossing may face high immigration fines when they try to leave.</p>
<p>The U.S. Coast Guard has concerns about security in the ports of Haiti. Until those are addressed, the Coast Guard advises mariners and passengers traveling through the ports of Haiti to exercise caution.</p>
<p><b>Limited Emergency Response</b></p>
<p>The U.S. government is very limited in its ability to help U.S. citizens in Haiti. Local police and first responders often do not have enough resources. This limits their ability to respond to emergencies or serious crimes. Shortages of gasoline, electricity, medicine, and medical supplies are common throughout the country. Public and private clinics, as well as hospitals, have untrained staff and lack basic resources. Medical providers almost always require upfront payment in cash.</p>
<p>U.S. government employees must follow a nightly curfew. Families of Embassy personnel are not allowed to accompany them on their assignment. Embassy personnel cannot travel by foot in Port-au-Prince. U.S. government employees working in Haiti must obtain special permission to travel outside the embassy compound due to security risks. They are also prohibited from:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using any kind of public transportation or taxis.&#8239;</li>
<li>Visiting banks and using ATMs.&#8239;</li>
<li>Driving at night.&#8239;</li>
<li>Traveling anywhere after dark.&#8239;</li>
</ul>

<p>If you decide to travel to Haiti:&#8239;</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid demonstrations and crowds.</li>
<li>Check local media for breaking events. Be prepared to adjust your plans.</li>
<li>Arrange airport transfers and hotels in advance, or have your host meet you upon arrival.&#8239;</li>
<li>Keep travel documents up to date and easily accessible.</li>
<li>Have evacuation plans that do not rely on U.S. government assistance.</li>
<li>Bring enough supply of over the counter and prescription medicines.&#8239;</li>
<li>If you are being followed as you leave the airport, drive to the nearest police station immediately.&#8239;</li>
<li>Develop a communication plan with family or your employer or host organization (if you are traveling on business). This is so they can monitor your safety and location as you travel through high-risk areas. Specify how you will confirm you are safe (text, calls, etc.), how often, and who you will contact first to share the information.</li>
<li>Choose one family member to serve as the point of contact. They will communicate with kidnappers or hostage-takers, media, U.S. and host country government agencies, and members of Congress if you are kidnapped or taken hostage.</li>
<li>Establish a proof of life protocol with your loved ones. This is so that if you are taken hostage, your loved ones can know specific questions (and answers) to ask the hostage-takers to be sure that you are alive (and to rule out a hoax).</li>
<li>Draft a will and designate appropriate insurance beneficiaries and/or power of attorney, put your financial affairs in order.</li>
<li>Discuss a plan with loved ones regarding care/custody of children, pets, property, belongings, non-liquid assets (collections, artwork, etc.), funeral wishes, etc.</li>
<li>Leave DNA samples with your medical provider in case it is necessary for your family to access them.</li>
<li>Travel by vehicle to reduce walking in public.&#8239;</li>
<li>Travel in groups or at least do not travel alone.&#8239;</li>
<li>Always keep vehicle doors locked, and windows closed when driving. Roadblocks may be operated by gangs, members of organized crime, or terrorists seeking money and may turn violent.&#8239;</li>
<li>Be cautious and alert. This is especially important when driving through markets and other crowded areas.&#8239;</li>
<li>Do not physically resist any robbery attempt.</li>

<li>All areas north of the Tropic of Cancer</li>
<li>All areas within 100 KM of the Mali and Algeria Border </li>
</ul>
<p><b>Country Summary:</b>&nbsp;Violent crimes occur frequently outside the Tevragh Zeina neighborhoods in Nouakchott. They include mugging, armed robbery, and assault. Local police lack the resources to respond quickly and effectively to serious crimes.

<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>U.S. Travel Limits and Emergency Services</b></p>
<p>The U.S. government can only offer limited emergency services to U.S. citizens in Mauritania. This is due to travel rules for U.S. government employees, poor infrastructure, and few health facilities, especially outside of Nouakchott.</p>
<p>U.S. government employees can travel outside Nouakchott only during the day. They cannot walk alone outside of specific areas and times. U.S. government employees must get special permission to travel outside Nouakchott. This helps them move smoothly through security checkpoints on major roads.</p>

<p>The government of Mauritania designates certain areas off-limits to foreigners and most Mauritanians. These &#8220;No Movement Zones&#8221; are very dangerous.

<p>U.S. Embassy Beirut personnel are restricted from personal travel without advance permission. Additional travel restrictions may be imposed on U.S. personnel under Chief of Mission security responsibility, with little to no notice due to increased security issues or threats.</p>
<p>Commercial flights are available, but at reduced capacity. Please check flight options at <a href="https://www.beirutairport.gov.lb/index.php?lang=en">Beirut&#8211;Rafic Hariri International Airport</a>.</p>
<p><b>Country Summary:</b> U.S.&nbsp;citizens in Lebanon should be aware that consular officers from the U.S. Embassy are not always able to travel to assist them. The Department of State considers the threat to U.S. government personnel in Beirut serious enough to require them to live and work under strict security. The internal security policies of the U.S. Embassy may be adjusted at any time and without advance notice.</p>
<p>Since October 8, 2023, cross-border exchanges of fire have occurred between Hizballah and Israel. In some instances, targets have been well north of the border region. A cessation of hostilities between Israel and Lebanon went into effect on November 27, and implementation is ongoing; however, there are continued instances of military activity in some areas of Lebanon. The Lebanese government cannot guarantee the safety of U.S. citizens against sudden outbreaks of violence and armed conflict. Family, neighborhood, or sectarian disputes can escalate quickly and can lead to gunfire or other violence with no warning.</p>
<p>Terrorist groups continue plotting possible attacks in Lebanon. Terrorists may conduct attacks with little or no warning targeting tourist locations, transportation hubs, markets/shopping malls, and local government facilities.</p>
<p>Local security authorities have noted a rise in violent crimes, including political violence. Multiple unsolved killings in Lebanon may have been politically motivated.</p>
<p>Kidnapping, whether for ransom, political motives, or family disputes, has occurred in Lebanon. Suspects in kidnappings may have ties to terrorist or criminal organizations.</p>
<p>Unexploded landmines and explosive remnants of war are a hazard along the border with Syria. Heed land mine warning signs. Do not venture off the road into areas marked off with red and white plastic tape. Avoid roadside ditches, shoulders, and unmarked trails. Never touch anything resembling unexploded munitions.</p>
<p>U.S. citizens should avoid demonstrations and exercise caution if in the vicinity of any large gatherings or protests as these have the potential to turn violent quickly and with little notice. Protesters have blocked major roads, including thoroughfares between downtown Beirut and the area where the U.S. Embassy is located, and between Beirut and Beirut-Rafic Hariri International Airport.</p>

<p><b>Southern Lebanon &#8211; Level 4: &nbsp;Do Not Travel, Depart If You Are There (See map below)</b></p>
<p>The U.S. Embassy strongly urges U.S. citizens to avoid southern Lebanon and to depart if you are there; that is, all parts south of the city of Saida, to include inland areas, as illustrated in the map below.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Updated to reflect change in overall travel advisory level from 3 to 2 due to decrease of election related protests, and addition of Niassa Special Reserve to Do Not Travel section.</p>
<p>Exercise increased caution when traveling to Mozambique due to&nbsp;<b>health issues</b>,&nbsp;<b>crime, civil unrest,</b>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<b>terrorism</b>. Some areas have&nbsp;greater&nbsp;risk. Read the entire Travel Advisory.</p>
<p><b>Do Not Travel To:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Cabo Delgado Province, the Niassa Special Reserve inside Niassa Province, and certain districts in the north of Nampula Province due to&nbsp;<b>terrorism</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Country Summary:&nbsp;</b>Unplanned protests remain possible throughout the country and can quickly become violent. Protests may temporarily block major roads, including toll booths and border crossings.</p>
<p>Violent crime, such as mugging, is common.</p>
<p>Mozambique&#8217;s health infrastructure is weak, medicine availability is variable and often in short supply. Local medical facilities may lack basic resources and supplies, and may require cash payment up front. There is risk of terrorist violence, including terrorist attacks and other activity in Mozambique. Visit the U.S. Department of State's <a href="https://www.state.gov/country-reports-on-terrorism/">country reports on terrorism</a> to learn more.</p>
<p>Terrorist groups in northern Mozambique continue to be active. Attackers may strike public areas and tourist destinations with little or no warning, sometimes taking hostages. Upscale lodges in remote areas which cater to international big-game hunters have been targeted. Security and police forces may be slow to respond.</p>

<p>Terrorists continue to conduct and plot attacks on government forces, villages, and key supply routes in Cabo Delgado Province and the bordering districts of Memba and Erati in Nampula Province. Cabo Delgado&#8217;s capitol city of Pemba is vulnerable to attack due to the proximity of violent extremist forces and their increasing sophistication. Upscale hunting lodges in and around the Niassa Special Reserve have been specifically targeted by terrorists with hostages taken.</p>
<p>Although prior terrorist attacks centered around securing resources from government forces, travelers should be aware of their surroundings, especially in large public places.</p>
<p>Be aware of increased government security checkpoints in Cabo Delgado Province.</p>
<p>If you must travel to the affected areas of Cabo Delgado, Niassa, and Nampula Provinces, consider hiring a security firm.</p>

<li>High crime areas, described in detail below.</li>

<p><b>Country Summary:</b>&nbsp;While violent crime in Jamaica has decreased since 2024, it remains statistically high throughout the country. Tourist areas generally see lower rates of violent crime than other parts of the country. The homicide rate reported by the Government of Jamaica is among the highest in the Western Hemisphere. Armed robberies and sexual assaults are common. U.S. embassy employees are prohibited from using public buses and from driving between cities at night.<b></b></p>
<p><b>Victims of crime<br>
</b>The U.S. Embassy routinely receives reports of sexual assaults, including from U.S. citizen tourists at resorts. U.S. citizens report slow or unsatisfactory response to serious criminal incidents. When arrests are made, cases are infrequently prosecuted to a final verdict and sentence.</p>
<p><b>Medical care<br>
</b>U.S. citizens should not expect the same level of health care available in Jamaica as is available in the United States. This includes slower emergency service response times and less availability of care for illness or injury. Private hospitals require payment up front before admitting patients and may not have the ability to provide specialized care. Ambulance services are not always staffed with EMTs and are not always readily available, especially in rural areas. U.S. citizens should bring extra prescription medication as common medications, such as insulin, can be difficult to obtain.</p>
<p>We highly recommend that you buy insurance before you travel. Check with your travel insurance provider about evacuation assistance, medical insurance, and trip cancellation coverage.<b>&nbsp;<u>The Department of State does not pay medical bills.</u></b></p>
<p><u>U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.</u>&nbsp;Air ambulance service to the United States can range from $30,000-$50,000.</p>
<p>Read the&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Jamaica.html">country information page</a>&nbsp;for additional information on travel to Jamaica.</p>
<p>If you decide to travel to Jamaica:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Do not attempt to bring firearms or ammunition.&nbsp;This includes stray rounds, shells, or empty casings.</b> The penalties for carrying firearms or ammunition, even by mistake, are severe, and can include long prison sentences.</li>

      <pubDate>Thu, 29 May 2025</pubDate>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><b>Updated to add risk indicator for kidnapping</b>.</p>
<p>Exercise increased caution in Brazil due to&#8239;crime&#8239;and&#8239;kidnapping. Some areas have increased risk. Read the entire Travel Advisory.</p>
<p>Do not travel to these areas due to&#8239;crime:&#8239;</p>
<ul>
<li>Anywhere within 160 km/100 miles of Brazil&#8217;s land borders with Bolivia, Colombia, Guyana, French Guiana, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, and Venezuela. This restriction does not apply to the Foz do Iguacu National Park or Pantanal National Park.&#8239;</li>
<li>Informal housing developments, such as favelas, vilas, comunidades, or conglomerados, at any time.</li>
<li>Brasilia&#8217;s &#8220;Satellite Cities&#8221; at night. This includes Ceilandia, Santa Maria, Sao Sebastiao, and Paranoa.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Country Summary:</b>&#8239;Violent crime, including murder, armed robbery, and carjacking, can occur in urban areas, day and night. There was a kidnapping for ransom of U.S. travelers. Gang activity and organized crime are widespread and often tied to the recreational drug trade. Assaults, including with sedatives and drugs placed in drinks, are common, especially in Rio de Janeiro. Criminals target foreigners through dating apps or at bars before drugging and robbing their victims. U.S. government employees are advised not to use municipal buses in Brazil because of a serious risk of robbery and assault, especially at night.</p>
<p>If you decide to travel to Brazil:&#8239;&#8239;</p>
<ul>
<li>Stay aware of your surroundings.&#8239;</li>
<li>Do not physically resist any robbery attempt.&#8239;</li>
<li>Do not accept food or drinks from strangers and always watch your drinks.&#8239;</li>
<li>Use caution when walking or driving at night.&#8239;</li>
<li>Avoid going to bars or nightclubs alone.&#8239;</li>
<li>Avoid walking on beaches after dark.&#8239;</li>
<li>Do not display signs of wealth, such as expensive watches or jewelry.&#8239;</li>
<li>Be alert to date drug scams.</li>
<li>Stay alert when visiting banks or ATMs.&#8239;</li>
<li>Be careful at major transportation centers or on public transport, especially at night. Passengers are at higher risk of robbery or assault when using public buses in Brazil.&#8239;</li>
<li>Use increased caution when hiking in isolated areas.&#8239;</li>
<li>Develop a communication plan with family, employer, or host organization so they can monitor your safety and location as you travel through high-risk areas. Specify how you'll confirm you're safe (text, calls, etc.), how often, and who you'll contact first to share the information.&#8239;</li>
<li>Enroll in the&#8239;<a href="https://step.state.gov/">Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP)</a>&#8239;to receive messages and alerts from the U.S. Embassy and make it easier to locate you in an emergency.&#8239;</li>

</ul>
<p><b>International Borders &#8211; Level 4: Do Not Travel&nbsp;</b><br>
Given security risks, U.S. government employees working in Brazil must obtain special authorization to travel within 160 km/100 miles of the international land borders with Bolivia, Colombia, Guyana, French Guiana, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, and Venezuela. Travel to the Foz do Iguacu National Park and Pantanal National Park is allowed.&#8239;</p>

<p><b>Informal Housing Developments (commonly known as favelas, vilas, comunidades or conglomerados) &#8211; Level 4: Do Not Travel&nbsp;</b><br>
Given crime concerns, U.S. government employees working in Brazil must obtain special authorization to travel to informal housing developments in Brazil.</p>
<p>Do not travel to informal housing developments, even on guided tours. Neither tour companies nor police can guarantee your safety when entering these communities. Even in areas that police or local governments deem safe, the situation can change quickly. While some informal housing developments have clear boundaries, other such areas may be less obvious, and may be identified by crowded quarters, impoverished conditions, or irregular construction. Exercise caution near these communities as gang fighting and police clashes sometimes move beyond the confines of these areas.</p>
<p>Check the Safety and Security Section on the&#8239;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Brazil.html">country information page</a>&#8239;and consult&#8239;<a href="https://br.usembassy.gov/services/maps-of-u-s-citizen-caution-areas/" adhocenable="false">the maps on the Embassy&#8217;s website</a>&#8239;for details about favelas.&#8239;</p>

Given crime risks, U.S. government employees working in Brazil must obtain special authorization to travel to Brasilia&#8217;s Administrative Regions of Ceilandia, Santa Maria, Sao Sebastiao, and Paranoa between 6:00 p.m. and 6:00&#8239;a.m.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><b><i>Reissued after periodic review with updates regarding the resumption of cross-border movement between the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan.</i></b></p>
<p>Exercise increased caution in Tajikistan due to&nbsp;<b>the risk of</b> <b>terrorism, unexploded landmines, occasional violence near the border with the Kyrgyz Republic, and limited ability to assist U.S.-Tajik dual nationals</b>. Some areas have increased risk. Read the entire Travel Advisory.</p>
<p>Reconsider travel to<b>:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Tajikistan&#8217;s border with Afghanistan due to <b>terrorism</b>.</li>
<li>Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Oblast (GBAO) due to the <b>potential for armed conflict</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Country Summary:</b>&nbsp;Terrorist organizations are known to have a presence in the region and have targeted foreigners and local authorities in the past.</p>
<p><b>Terrorists may attack</b> with little or no warning. They target:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tourist locations</li>
<li>Transportation hubs</li>
<li>Markets and shopping malls</li>
<li>Restaurants</li>
<li>Places of worship</li>
<li>Schools</li>
<li>Government facilities.</li>
</ul>
<p>Visit the U.S. Department of State <a href="https://www.state.gov/country-reports-on-terrorism/">Country Reports on Terrorism</a> to learn more.</p>
<p><b>Unexploded landmines</b>&nbsp;and cluster munitions are a hazard along the Afghan-Tajik and Uzbek-Tajik borders, as well as in the Vakhsh and Rasht valleys. Pay attention to land mine warning signs. Do not venture off the road into areas marked with red and white plastic tape. Avoid roadside ditches, shoulders, and unmarked trails in these regions. Never touch anything resembling unexploded munitions.</p>
<p>Be cautious when traveling&nbsp;<b>near, along, and through the Tajikistan-Kyrgyz Republic land border</b> as there have been several instances of armed skirmishes between Tajik and Kyrgyz border guards over the past five years, particularly in the Isfara area and the Vorukh enclave. In March 2025, the March 13, 2025, signing and subsequent ratification of bilateral agreements between the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan have facilitated the resumption of cross-border movement at the Guliston&#8211;Kyzyl-Bel and Madaniyat&#8211;Kayragach border crossing points.</p>
<p>Tajikistan does not recognize dual nationality with the United States. Dual U.S.-Tajik citizens and U.S. citizens of Tajik descent may be subject to additional scrutiny and harassment from local authorities and may be denied access to U.S. consular officials while in detention.</p>
<p>Read the&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Tajikistan.html">country information page</a>&nbsp;for additional information on travel to Tajikistan.</p>
<p>If you decide to travel to Tajikistan:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enter Tajikistan on your U.S. passport and keep it with you.</li>
<li>Have a plan to depart Tajikistan which does not rely on U.S. government assistance.</li>
<li>Keep a low profile.</li>
<li>Be aware of your surroundings.</li>
<li>Monitor local media for breaking events and be prepared to adjust your plans.</li>
<li>Do not touch unknown metal objects and avoid traveling off well-used roads, tracks, and paths due to risk of unexploded ordnance.</li>
<li>If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately.</li>

<p><b><u>Border Areas with Afghanistan &#8211; Level 3: Reconsider Travel<br>
</u></b>Reconsider travel in proximity of Tajikistan's border with Afghanistan due to terrorism. The current political situation in Afghanistan creates a challenging and unpredictable security environment in the border areas. Travel in the mountainous region along the Afghan border can be dangerous due to the proximity of militant groups across the border. Due to the risks, U.S. government employees working in Tajikistan must obtain special authorization to travel to border areas with Afghanistan. U.S. citizens should remain alert and avoid activities that develop predictable patterns of movement. If documenting travel on social media, ensure your privacy settings do not reveal your exact location.</p>

<p><b><u>Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Oblast (GBAO)&#8211; Level 3: Reconsider Travel<br>
</u></b>The challenging and unpredictable environment in northern Afghanistan has the potential to create insecurity in neighboring Tajikistan&#8217;s GBAO region. GBAO is a restricted region for non-Tajik citizens, requiring travel permits from Tajik authorities. Violent clashes with security forces have erupted in GBAO in recent years, and the government of Tajikistan can suspend travel permits for non-Tajik citizens on short notice. Due to the risks, U.S. government employees working in Tajikistan must obtain special authorization to travel to GBAO.</p>

      <title>Peru - Level 2: Exercise Increased Caution</title>

      <pubDate>Fri, 16 May 2025</pubDate>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><b><i>Reissued after periodic review with minor edits.</i></b></p>
<p>Exercise increased caution due to&#8239;<b>crime, civil unrest, and the risk of kidnapping.</b>&nbsp;Some areas have increased risk. Read the entire Travel Advisory.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do not travel to:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Colombia-Peru border area in the Loreto Region due to&#8239;<b>crime</b>.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The Valley of the Apur&#237;mac, Ene, and Mantaro Rivers (VRAEM), which includes Vilcabamba, due to&#8239;<b>crime</b>&#8239;and threats of <b>terrorism</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Some areas within the regions of Ayacucho, Cusco*, Huancavelica, and Jun&#237;n, due to&#8239;<b>crime</b>&#8239;and threats of <b>terrorism</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>* <b>The city of</b> <b>Cusco and popular tourist sites nearby, like the Sacred Valley, the Inca Trail, and Machu Picchu, are not located in the affected area.&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Country Summary:</b>&nbsp;Crime is common in Peru. Petty theft, carjackings, muggings, assaults, and other violent crime often happen even in daylight hours and with many witnesses around. Kidnapping is rare, but it does occur. The risk of crime increases at night. Criminal groups sometimes set up roadblocks to rob people in areas outside of Lima.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Ayahuasca and Kambo Usage<br>
</b>U.S. travelers should not use Ayahuasca or Kambo because of the known dangers. U.S. citizens have suffered serious illness and, in some cases, died after taking these drugs. They have also been sexually assaulted, injured, or robbed while under the influence of these substances.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Demonstrations<br>
</b>Demonstrations occur regularly throughout the country. Public demonstrations can take place for a variety of political and economic issues.&nbsp;&nbsp; Demonstrations can shut down local roads, trains, and major highways. This often happens without warning or clear information on reopening times.&nbsp; Road closures can limit access to public transportation and airports. Closures may also disrupt travel in and between cities.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Due to road safety risks, U.S. government employees working in Peru are prohibited from nighttime driving </b>except within cities, between Lima and Huacho (to the north), and Lima and Paracas (to the south). U.S. government employees working in Peru may travel at night with commercial bus companies along the Pan-American Highway, to Huaraz, and on the Lima-Arequipa-Cusco corridor.</p>
<p>Read the&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Peru.html">country information page</a>&nbsp;for additional information on travel to Peru.</p>

<li>Check local media for breaking news. Be prepared to adjust your plans.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Avoid demonstrations and large crowds.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Develop a communication plan with family or your employer or host organization (if you are traveling on business), so that they can monitor your safety and location as you travel through high-risk areas. Specify how you'll confirm you're safe (text, calls, etc.), how often, and who you'll contact first to share the information.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Enroll in the&#8239;<a href="http://step.state.gov/">Smart Traveler Enrollment Program</a>&#8239;(<a href="http://step.state.gov/">STEP</a>) to receive messages and Alerts from the U.S. Embassy and make it easier to locate you in an emergency.&nbsp;</li>

<p><b>Colombian-Peruvian border area in the Loreto Region &#8211; Level 4: Do Not Travel</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Do not travel to these areas for any reason.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Drug trafficking and crime, plus poor infrastructure, limit how well Peruvian law enforcement can operate in this area.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Due to the risks, U.S. government employees working in Peru must obtain special authorization to travel within 20 kilometers of the Peru-Colombia border in the Loreto region.&nbsp; They cannot travel on the Putumayo River, which forms much of the Peru-Colombia border.&nbsp; Due to the risks, the U.S. government cannot provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in this area.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Valley of the Apur&#237;mac, Ene, and Mantaro Rivers (VRAEM) includes areas within the Departments of Ayacucho, Cusco, Huancavelica, and Jun&#237;n &#8211; Level 4: Do Not Travel</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Do not travel to these areas for any reason.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Drug trafficking and crime, plus poor infrastructure, weaken Peruvian law enforcement&#8217;s ability to act effectively in this area.&nbsp;</li>

<p>Do not travel to Somalia due to <b>crime</b>, <b>terrorism</b>, <b>civil unrest</b>, <b>health</b>, <b>kidnapping</b>, <b>piracy</b>, and<b> lack of availability of routine consular services</b>.</p>
<p><b>Country Summary<br>
</b>Due to security risks, U.S. government employees working in Somalia are prohibited from traveling outside the Mogadishu International Airport complex where the U.S. Embassy is located. The U.S. Embassy in Mogadishu maintains normal staffing.</p>
<p><b>Crime<br>
</b>Violent crime is common throughout Somalia, including kidnapping and murder. Illegal roadblocks are widespread.</p>
<p><b>Terrorism<br>
</b>Terrorists continue to plot kidnappings, bombings, and other attacks in Somalia. They may attack with little or no warning and target:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Airports</li>
<li>Seaports</li>
<li>Government buildings</li>
<li>Hotels and restaurants</li>
<li>Shopping areas</li>
<li>Public places that attract large crowds and tourists</li>
<li>Government, military, and other convoys</li>
</ul>
<p>Attack methods can include car bombs, suicide bombers, individual attackers, and rocket fire.</p>
<p>Some areas, like the Somaliland region, have seen less terrorist activity. However, violence and explosive attacks can happen anywhere in Somalia, at any time.</p>
<p><b>Civil Unrest<br>
</b>Protests and demonstrations occur throughout Somalia. They can sometimes turn violent.</p>
<ul>
<li>Check local media for breaking events. Be prepared to adjust your plans.</li>
<li>Keep travel documents up to date and easily accessible.</li>
<li>Have evacuation plans that do not rely on U.S. government assistance.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Health<br>
</b>Medical facilities in Somalia have limited capacity. They are often absent in rural areas. The health care system lacks sufficient pharmaceuticals, medical supplies, and medical professionals. Hospitals do not meet U.S. standards.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Bring enough supply of over the counter and prescription medicines, along with copies of their prescriptions, including the generic name for the medicines.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Piracy<br>
</b>Pirates are active in the waters off the Horn of Africa, specifically off the coast of Puntland.</p>
<p><b>Kidnapping</b><br>
Violent crime, including kidnapping, is common throughout Somalia. Illegal roadblocks are widespread.</p>
<p><b>Lack of availability of consular services<br>
</b>The U.S. government has extremely limited ability to help U.S. citizens in Somalia. There is no permanent consular officer in Somalia, not even the Somaliland region. If a traveler&#8217;s passport is lost, stolen, expires, or if they become destitute, the U.S. government may not be able to help.</p>
<p><b>Other issues<br>
</b>Some schools and other facilities act as &#8220;rehabilitation&#8221; centers. These facilities exist throughout Somalia with little or no licensing and oversight. Reports of physical abuse are common. People also report being held against their will in these facilities.</p>
<p>There are frequent reports of U.S. citizens who have their passports taken by family members, leaving them unable to leave Somalia. This often occurs when U.S. citizens travel to Somalia to visit family or attend an event. Some adult U.S. citizens cannot leave the international airport because they need explicit consent from their family.</p>
<p>Due to risks to civil aviation from extremist and military activity, the Federal Aviation Administration has issued a Special Federal Aviation Regulation that bans certain U.S. flights within or near Somalia. For more information, U.S. citizens should consult the <a href="https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions">Federal Aviation Administration&#8217;s Prohibitions, Restrictions, and Notices</a>.</p>

<li>Make a plan to exit Somalia rapidly if the situation gets worse. Identify multiple options for leaving Somalia and know the entry requirements for U.S. citizens in to neighboring countries.</li>
<li>Avoid sailing near the coast of Somalia and review the <a href="https://icc-ccs.org/map/">Live Piracy Report</a> published by the International Maritime Bureau.</li>
<li>Draft a will and designate appropriate insurance beneficiaries and/or power of attorney.</li>
<li>Discuss a plan with loved ones regarding care/custody of children, pets, property, belongings, non-liquid assets (collections, artwork, etc.), funeral wishes, etc.</li>

<li>Make your own personal security plan with your employer or host organization (if you are traveling on business) or consider consulting with a professional security organization.</li>
<li>Develop a communication plan with family and/or your employer or host organization (if you are traveling on business), so that they can monitor your safety and location as you travel through high-risk areas. This plan should specify whom you would contact first, and how that person should share the information.</li>
<li>Identify key sources of possible assistance for you and your family in case of emergency, such as your employer (if traveling on business), and local friends/family as well as friends/family outside Somalia.</li>
<li>Appoint one family member to be the point of contact with hostage-takers and media.</li>
<li>Appoint a family member to be the contact for the U.S. and host country government agencies, and members of Congress if you are taken hostage or detained.</li>
<li>Discuss a proof of life protocol with your loved ones, so that if you are taken hostage, your loved ones can know specific questions (and answers) to ask the hostage-takers to be sure that you are alive (and to rule out a scam).</li>
<li>Leave DNA samples with your medical provider in case it is necessary for your family to access them.</li>
<li>Erase any sensitive photos, comments, or other materials from your social media pages, cameras, laptops, and other electronic devices. These could be considered controversial or provocative by local groups.</li>

      <title>Burma (Myanmar) - Level 4: Do Not Travel</title>
      <link>https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/burma-travel-advisory.html</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 12 May 2025</pubDate>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><b>Updated to reflect changes to risk indicators, restrictions on U.S. government personnel, and the &#8220;<i>If you decide to travel to Burma&#8221;</i> section.</b></p>
<p>Do not travel to Burma due to&nbsp;<b>armed conflict, the potential for civil unrest, arbitrary enforcement of local laws, poor health infrastructure, land mines and unexploded ordnance, crime, and</b>&nbsp;<b>wrongful detentions</b>.</p>
<p><b>Country Summary: </b>The Burma military regime deposed elected leaders and officials in a February 2021 coup d'&#233;tat. Protests and demonstrations against military rule can occur on significant dates. The military has responded to those protests with violence and by<b>&nbsp;arbitrarily detaining </b>protesters and bystanders.</p>
<p>The Department has determined that U.S. nationals are at&nbsp;significant <b>risk of wrongful detention</b> by military regime authorities. Wrongfully detained U.S. nationals have been held in prison for years, often in poor conditions and without fair and transparent treatment or consistent access to U.S. Embassy officials or their families.</p>
<p>Due to the unpredictable nature of ongoing armed conflict and potential civil unrest in Burma, U.S. government employees working in Burma may be prohibited from traveling within the country.</p>
<p>Due to the risks in the country, dependents under the age of 21 cannot accompany U.S. government employees who work in Burma.</p>
<p><b>Armed conflicts</b>&nbsp;occur throughout Burma, and the potential for civil unrest is high. The level of armed conflict and civil unrest&nbsp;varies significantly between and within states and regions and may change at any time.</p>
<p>Attacks by opposition militia on locations connected to the military and security authorities regularly occur in Rangoon and many other parts of the country. Local opposition militia groups actively operate around the country. Travelers are cautioned of the potential for the regime to limit access to highways and airports, causing an isolating situation.</p>
<p>Improvised explosive devices (IEDs) are used in the ongoing armed conflicts, including within the greater Rangoon area. From January to December 2024, the U.S. Embassy in Rangoon calculated an average of 21 explosions per month detonated against regime personnel and facilities in Rangoon. Outside of Rangoon, there have been IED attacks against checkpoints and military, administrative, and police facilities.</p>
<p><b>Land mines and unexploded ordnance (UXO)&nbsp;exist throughout Burma, </b>and their locations are often not marked or otherwise unidentifiable. The military regime will often&nbsp;<b>arbitrarily enforce local laws</b>, including<b> </b>detaining individuals<b> without fair and transparent treatment</b>. Foreigners, including U.S. citizens, are not excluded from this practice. U.S. citizens traveling or residing in Burma may be detained, and regime authorities could deny a prisoner access to U.S. consular services or information about the alleged crime.</p>
<p>Local law enforcement officials may also detain and/or deport U.S. citizens for speaking out or protesting against the military regime, including on their personal social media accounts, and for sending private electronic messages critical of the military regime, regardless of whether they were physically in Burma when they did so.</p>
<p>Burma has&nbsp;<b>limited and/or inadequate healthcare and emergency medical resources.</b></p>
<p>As of April 2024, the Burma military regime began implementing a <b>military conscription law </b>for males up to age 45 and females up to age 35. The military regime may prevent departure of people they view as eligible for conscription, including U.S. citizens who previously held Burmese nationality, and force them into the military.</p>
<p><b>Crime </b>in Burma has been increasing. Violent crime against foreigners is rare, but there have been incidents involving attacks by taxi drivers and muggings. People are advised to take particular care when taking taxis late at night.</p>
<p>Foreign nationals, including U.S. citizens, have been trafficked into Burma and forced to work in internet scam centers, often located in active conflict zones along Burma's eastern borders. These victims often respond to ads promising jobs in Thailand and are then forced or unwittingly lured into working at scam centers in Burma.&nbsp;</p>

      <title>Venezuela - Level 4: Do Not Travel</title>
      <link>https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/venezuela-travel-advisory.html</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 12 May 2025</pubDate>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><b><i>Reissued May 12, 2025, to emphasize the extreme danger to U.S. citizens living in or traveling to Venezuela.</i></b></p>
<p><b>Do not travel to or remain in Venezuela due to</b>&nbsp;<b>the high risk of&nbsp;wrongful detention,&nbsp;torture in detention,</b> <b>terrorism, kidnapping, arbitrary enforcement of local laws, crime</b>,&nbsp;<b>civil unrest,</b>&nbsp;<b>and poor health infrastructure</b>. &nbsp;<b>All U.S. citizens and Lawful Permanent Residents in Venezuela are strongly advised to depart immediately.</b></p>
<p><b>Country Summary:&#8239;</b>&nbsp;In March 2019, the U.S. Department of State withdrew all diplomatic personnel from U.S. Embassy Caracas and suspended operations.&nbsp; All consular services, routine and emergency, remain suspended until further notice.&nbsp; The U.S. government has no ability to provide emergency services or consular assistance to U.S. citizens in Venezuela.&nbsp; Anyone with U.S. citizenship or any other U.S. residency status in Venezuela should leave the country immediately, including those traveling on Venezuelan or other foreign passports.&nbsp; <b>Do not travel to Venezuela for any reason. </b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Department has determined there is a very high risk of wrongful detention of U.S. nationals in Venezuela. &nbsp;Security forces have detained U.S. citizens for up to five years without respect for due process. &nbsp;The U.S. government is not generally informed of the detention of U.S. citizens in Venezuela nor is it permitted to visit U.S. national detainees in Venezuela. &nbsp;The U.S. government has no way to contact U.S. nationals detained in Venezuela, and those detained are not allowed to contact family members or independent legal counsel. &nbsp;According to former detainees, as well as independent human rights organizations, detainees have been subjected to torture and cruel, inhumane, or degrading treatment or punishment, including severe beatings, prolonged restraint in stress positions, and waterboarding.</p>
<p>Violent crimes, such as homicide, armed robbery, kidnapping, and carjacking, are common in Venezuela. &nbsp;Political rallies and demonstrations occur, often with little notice. &nbsp;Police and security forces have instituted a brutal crackdown on pro-democracy or anti-regime demonstrations, including the use of tear gas, pepper spray, and rubber bullets against participants, which occasionally devolve into looting and vandalism.</p>
<p>Colombian terrorist groups operate in Venezuela&#8217;s border areas with Colombia, Brazil, and Guyana.</p>
<p>Shortages of gasoline, electricity, water, medicine, and medical supplies continue throughout much of Venezuela.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Read the&#8239;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Venezuela.html">country information page</a>&#8239;for additional information on travel to Venezuela.</p>
<p>If you decide to travel to Venezuela:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prepare a will and designate appropriate insurance beneficiaries and/or power of attorney.</li>
<li>Develop a communication plan with family and/or an employer or host organization. &nbsp;A plan should include a &#8220;proof of life&#8221; protocol with loved ones so that if you are taken hostage, detained, and/or tortured, your loved ones will know specific questions (and answers) to ask the hostage-takers to confirm you are still alive.&nbsp; This will help expose scam artists who attempt to falsely extort your family members by claiming the ability to have you released.</li>
<li>Consider hiring a professional security organization.</li>
<li>Any contingency plans for travel to or from Venezuela should <b>not</b> rely on U.S. government assistance.</li>
<li>The U.S. government <b>cannot</b> assist U.S. citizens in Venezuela in replacing lost or expired travel documents or obtaining Venezuelan entry or exit stamps.</li>
<li>The U.S. government will <b>not</b> be able to assist should the need for a medical emergency or evacuation arise. &nbsp;U.S. citizens in Venezuela should consider purchasing medical evacuation insurance.</li>
<li>There is no safe way to travel to Venezuela.&nbsp; Avoid travel to Venezuela via any means, including via land border crossings where even crossing over into Venezuela by a few feet can result in detention. &nbsp;Nighttime travel between cities or between Sim&#243;n Bol&#237;var International Airport and Caracas is especially risky. &nbsp;<a name="_Hlk177567032" id="_Hlk177567032"></a>Entering or attempting to enter Venezuela without a valid Venezuelan visa will likely lead to indefinite detention without consular access. &nbsp;Visas are not available upon entry.<a name="_Hlk177567184" id="_Hlk177567184"></a>&nbsp; U.S. citizens in Venezuela face a high risk of indefinite detention without consular access. &nbsp;Visas and residence permits may be canceled at any time without warning, and U.S. citizens holding a valid visa may be arbitrarily detained at any time.</li>
<li>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice&nbsp;to Airmen (NOTAM) due to risks to civil aviation safety in Venezuelan airspace. For more information U.S. citizens should consult the <a href="https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions" adhocenable="false">Federal Aviation Administration&#8217;s Prohibitions, Restrictions and Notices</a>.&nbsp; &nbsp;</li>
<li>Travelers face increased risk using unregulated taxis from the Maiquetia &#8220;Sim&#243;n Bol&#237;var&#8221; International Airport and using ATMs in the area.</li>
<li>Over the counter and prescription medicines are unlikely to be available to U.S. citizens in Venezuela. &nbsp;Bring enough supplies of over the counter and prescription medicines to last your entire stay in Venezuela.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Access to medical care in Venezuela is limited. &nbsp;Facilities may not have adequate supplies of basic medications.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Update <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/venezuela">vaccinations</a> to include all up-to-date standard vaccinations, plus Yellow Fever, Meningitis, Typhoid, Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B, and a Polio booster. &nbsp;All visitors should take Malaria prophylaxis.&nbsp;Venezuela is high risk for Malaria.&nbsp;</li>

      <title>Russia - Level 4: Do Not Travel</title>
      <link>https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/russia-travel-advisory.html</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 08 May 2025</pubDate>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><i>Reissued after periodic review.</i></p>
<p><b>Do not travel to Russia</b> <b>due to:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Danger associated with the continuing war between Russia and Ukraine.<b></b></li>
<li>The risk of harassment or wrongful detention by Russian security officials.<b></b></li>
<li>The arbitrary enforcement of local laws.<b></b></li>
<li>The possibility of terrorism.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>U.S. citizens in Russia should leave immediately.<br>
</b>The U.S. government has limited ability to help U.S. citizens in Russia, especially outside of Moscow. The U.S. Embassy in Moscow has reduced its staff and the Russian government has restricted travel for embassy personnel. All U.S. consulates in Russia have suspended operations, including consular services. <b>Do not travel to Russia for any reason.</b></p>
<p>The U.S. Embassy in Moscow has limited ability to assist in the case of a detention of a U.S. citizen. There is no guarantee that a U.S. citizen will be afforded consular access or released before their entire prison sentence is served. The risk of wrongful detention of U.S. nationals remains high. Even if a case is determined wrongful, there is no guarantee of release.</p>
<p>Russian officials have questioned and threatened U.S. citizens without reason. Russian security services have arrested U.S. citizens on false charges. They have denied them fair treatment and convicted them without credible evidence. Russian authorities have opened questionable investigations against U.S. citizens for their religious activities.</p>
<p>There have been drone attacks and explosions near the border with Ukraine, and in Moscow, Kazan, St. Petersburg, and other large cities. In 2024, ISIS Khorasan claimed responsibility for the attack at Crocus Music Hall in Moscow that killed 130 people, as well as attacks in Dagestan targeting places of worship. In an emergency, you should follow instructions from local authorities and seek shelter.</p>
<p><b>Dual citizenship<br>
</b>Russia will <b>not</b> recognize your U.S. citizenship if you are a dual U.S.-Russian citizen or have a claim to Russian citizenship.</p>
<ul>
<li>Russia has blocked U.S. consular officers from visiting detained dual U.S.-Russian citizens.</li>
<li>The Russian government has forced people with dual citizenship to join the military and has stopped them from leaving the country.</li>
<li>In 2022, Russia started drafting citizens for the war in Ukraine. The military draft is ongoing.<b></b></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Demonstrations<br>
</b>In Russia, peaceful assembly and freedom of speech are not protected rights. U.S. citizens should avoid protests and taking photos of security staff at these events. Russian authorities have arrested U.S. citizens who have joined protests. Russians and U.S. citizens have been detained for posts on social media.</p>
<p><b>Electronic devices<br>
</b>Reconsider bringing electronic devices into Russia. U.S. citizens should assume all electronic communications and devices in Russia are monitored by Russian security services. Russian security services have arrested U.S. citizens and other foreign nationals based on information found on electronic devices. This includes information that was created, transmitted, or stored while in another country.</p>
<p><b>Debit and credit cards<br>
</b>U.S. credit and debit cards no longer work in Russia. Due to sanctions, sending electronic money transfers from the United States to Russia is nearly impossible.</p>
<p><b>Air travel<br>
</b>There are few commercial air travel options available. It may not be easy to book flights on short notice. If you wish to leave Russia, you should make your own travel plans. The U.S. Embassy can only offer limited help to U.S. citizens trying to leave. Transportation options could become even more limited at any time.</p>
<p>Click&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/informationforuscitizeninrussia.html">here&nbsp;</a>for Information for U.S. Citizens Seeking to Depart Russia.</p>
<p>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has downgraded Russia's air safety rating from <a href="https://www.faa.gov/travelers/international_travel">Category 1 to Category 2 due to safety concerns</a>. U.S. government personnel outside of Russia generally are not allowed to fly on Russian airlines due to safety concerns.</p>
<p>Additionally, the FAA banned U.S. flights within certain areas of Russian airspace, by issuing a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM). This is due to risks to civil aviation operating within or in the vicinity of these certain areas. For more information U.S. citizens should consult the <a href="https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions#RussianFederation">Federal Aviation Administration&#8217;s Prohibitions, Restrictions and Notices</a>.</p>
<p><b>Laws and special circumstances<br>
</b>Russian officials have questioned, threatened, and detained U.S. citizens without reason. This includes both former and current U.S. government and military personnel, as well as private U.S. citizens. Russian authorities have a history of wrongfully detaining U.S. nationals and using them as bargaining chips.</p>
<ul>
<li>U.S. citizens may become victims of harassment, mistreatment, and extortion.</li>
<li>Russian authorities do not always notify the U.S. Embassy about the detention of a U.S. citizen. They may delay or deny U.S. consular assistance.</li>
<li>Russian security services target foreign nationals and international organizations considered &#8220;undesirable.&#8221;</li>
<li>Russian law allows authorities to punish foreigners for treason. This includes working for organizations that Russia perceives as acting against Russian interests. Former and current U.S. government employees and contractors should pay special attention to this part of Russian law.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Security<br>
</b>There have been drone attacks and explosions near the border with Ukraine and in Moscow, Kazan, St. Petersburg, and other large cities. In an emergency, you should follow instructions from local authorities and seek shelter.</p>
<p>Russia's war in Ukraine has destabilized security in southwestern Russia. In October 2022, the Russian government declared martial law in the following border areas with Ukraine: Bryansk, Kursk, Belgorod, Voronezh, Rostov, and Krasnodar.</p>
<p>Under martial law, authorities can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set curfews</li>
<li>Seize property</li>
<li>Restrict movement</li>
<li>Detain foreigners</li>
<li>Forcibly relocate residents</li>
<li>Limit public gatherings</li>
</ul>
<p>Russian authorities have questioned, detained, and arrested people for &#8220;acting against Russia's interests.&#8221; Local authorities have targeted people for posting on social media or supporting &quot;anti-Russian&quot; groups. They have punished people for criticizing the government or military.</p>
<p><b>LGB travelers<br>
</b>The Russian government's current &quot;propaganda&quot; law bans discussion of LGB topics. The community has been labeled as extremist, and it is considered a crime to support the human rights of LGB people in Russia. Displaying certain symbols, including the rainbow flag, is a crime.</p>
<p><b>Terrorism<br>
</b>Terrorists continue to plan and carry out attacks in Russia. The March 2024 Crocus City Hall incident in Moscow proved terrorists can strike suddenly.</p>
<p>U.S. government employees working in Russia are prohibited from traveling to the North Caucasus, including Chechnya and Mt. Elbrus.</p>
<p><b>Russian annexation of territories<br>
</b>The international community does not recognize Russia&#8217;s annexation of Crimea, Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhya.</p>
<p>Russia staged its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, in part, from occupied Crimea. There is a heavy Russian military presence in these areas and intense fighting across these regions.</p>
<p>Russian authorities have abused foreigners and locals. In particular, they have targeted people who they see as opposing Russia&#8217;s authority.<b></b></p>
<p>The U.S. Embassy in Kyiv, Ukraine offers consular services to U.S. citizens in Crimea, Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhya. However, the ongoing war limits the Embassy's ability to help U.S. citizens in these areas.</p>
<p><b>If you choose to disregard the Travel Advisory and decide to travel to Russia:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Department has determined that the risk of wrongful detention of U.S. nationals is significant.</li>
<li>Be ready for the possibility of detention for an unknown amount of time, possibly without a clear reason, and without the ability to contact your embassy or anyone else for help.</li>
<li>Prepare a will and designate appropriate insurance beneficiaries or power of attorney.</li>
<li>Share important documents, login information, and points of contact with loved ones so that they can manage your affairs if you are unable to return as planned to the United States. Review this list of documents to prepare for your trip.</li>
<li>Discuss a plan with loved ones regarding care and custody of children, pets, property, belongings, non-liquid assets (collections, artwork, etc.), funeral wishes, etc.</li>
<li>Leave DNA samples with your medical provider in case it is necessary for your family to access them.</li>
<li>Develop a communication plan with family, your employer or host organization. List how and when you'll confirm you're safe (text or call). Specify how often you will do this.</li>
<li>Have evacuation plans that do not rely on U.S. government assistance. Read the information on <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/what-state-dept-can-cant-do-crisis.html">what the U.S. government can and cannot do to assist you in an emergency overseas</a>.</li>

<li>Consider the risks involved in having dual U.S.-Russian nationality.</li>
<li>Log out of all social media accounts and do not access your social media accounts while in Russia.</li>
<li>Keep travel documents up-to-date and easily accessible.</li>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Reissued after periodic review with changes.</p>
<p>Exercise increased caution in Uruguay due to <b>crime</b>.</p>
<p><b>Country Summary:<br>

<ul>
<li>Montevideo</li>
<li>Canelones</li>
<li>Maldonado</li>
<li>Rivera</li>
</ul>
<p>Violent crimes, such as homicides, armed robberies, car jackings, and thefts occur throughout the country. These crimes happen at any time and have affected U.S. citizens. Criminals commonly travel in pairs on motorcycles to approach unsuspecting victims with a weapon and demand personal belongings. Armed criminals also target grocery stores, restaurants, financial centers, and small businesses, in which innocent bystanders are often victimized.</p>

<li>Call 911 if you encounter a crime in progress. Do not physically resist any robbery attempt or try to stop a robbery in progress.</li>
<li>Be vigilant when visiting banks or using ATMs during non-daylight hours or in remote locations; criminals often target ATMs and businesses in the early morning hours.</li>

      <title>Cuba - Level 2: Exercise Increased Caution</title>
      <link>https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/cuba-travel-advisory.html</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 07 May 2025</pubDate>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Updated to reflect information on power grid failures and <a href="https://ofac.treasury.gov/sanctions-programs-and-country-information/cuba-sanctions">Department of the Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control</a> (OFAC) licenses for travel.</p>
<p>Exercise increased caution in Cuba due to<b>&nbsp;crime </b>and <b>unreliable electrical</b> <b>power</b>.</p>
<p><b>Country Summary:</b>&nbsp;Petty crime is a risk for travelers in Cuba. This includes pick pocketing, purse snatchings, and car break-ins. Violent crime, including armed robbery and homicide, is also on the rise in Cuba.</p>
<p>U.S. law and regulation prohibit travel to, from, or within Cuba for tourist activities. OFAC regulates travel to, from, and within Cuba by persons subject to U.S. jurisdiction, defined to include, among other things, all U.S. citizens or residents (wherever located) and anyone in the United States, regardless of their citizenship and nationality. Failure by a person subject to U.S. jurisdiction to act consistently with the regulations may result in penalties and criminal prosecution. Travel to Cuba without an OFAC license is illegal.</p>
<p>Cuba's electrical supply is unreliable. Since October 2024, there have been several prolonged nationwide power outages. Scheduled and unscheduled power cuts lasting up to 12 hours occur daily in Havana, and even longer outside the capital. Some large businesses, hotels, hospitals, and institutions use generators during power outages. However, they may have trouble keeping the generators running during a long outage due to the inconsistent and scarce availability of fuel.</p>
<p>U.S. citizens in Cuba or those planning to visit should check local news often to stay up to date. In Cuba, peaceful assembly and freedom of speech are not protected rights. U.S. citizens should avoid protests or demonstrations.</p>
<p>U.S. Embassy employees must follow a special notification process with the Government of Cuba to travel outside of Havana. This process can impact the embassy's ability to help U.S. citizens in Cuba during emergencies.</p>
<p>If a person subject to U.S. jurisdiction travels to Cuba consistent with 1 of the <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-31/subtitle-B/chapter-V/part-515/subpart-E/section-515.560">12 travel categories</a> authorized by a general OFAC license, the person would not need to apply for a specific OFAC license for the travel transactions. For non-tourist travel that is not otherwise covered by a general license, a person subject to U.S. jurisdiction must seek a specific license from OFAC to authorize the travel. For travel questions, check <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-31/subtitle-B/chapter-V/part-515/subpart-E/section-515.560">31 C.F.R. 515.560</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://ofac.treasury.gov/sanctions-programs-and-country-information/cuba-sanctions">OFAC&#8217;s Frequently Asked Questions</a>.</p>

      <title>Papua New Guinea - Level 3: Reconsider Travel</title>
      <link>https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/papua-new-guinea-travel-advisory.html</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2025</pubDate>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><b>Reissued after periodic review with minor edits.</b></p>
<p>Reconsider travel to Papua New Guinea due to&#8239;<b>crime, civil unrest,</b>&#8239;and&#8239;<b>piracy</b>. Exercise increased caution due to&#8239;<b>kidnapping, unexploded ordnance, inconsistent availability of healthcare services, and potential for natural disasters. </b>&#8239;Some areas have increased risk. Read the entire Travel Advisory.</p>
<p><b>Do not travel to:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Central Bougainville, particularly areas near the Panguna mine, due to&#8239;<b>civil unrest</b>.</li>
<li>The Highlands region, other than the towns of Mt. Hagen and Goroka, due to&#8239;<b>civil unrest</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Country Summary:</b>&#8239;&nbsp;<b>Violent crime</b>, including sexual assault, carjackings, home invasions, and armed robberies, is common. There have been reports of criminals attacking resorts popular with foreign tourists to steal goods and money. Tensions between communal or tribal groups may lead to&#8239;<b>civil unrest</b>&#8239;involving violence and can occur without warning. Police presence is limited outside of the capital, Port Moresby, and police may be unable to assist due to limited resources.</p>
<p>The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens outside of Port Moresby due to limited transportation infrastructure. U.S. government employees must obtain authorization before traveling to certain areas, including the central part of Bougainville and the provinces of Southern Highlands, Western Highlands (excluding Mt. Hagen), Eastern Highlands (excluding Goroka), Hela, Enga, Jiwaka, and other areas of Papua New Guinea where one is unable to fly directly.</p>
<p><b>Piracy</b>&#8239;is active in the waters surrounding Papua New Guinea. Travelers by boat should reconsider travel to the Bismarck and Solomon Seas along Papua New Guinea's north and eastern coasts. In 2021 and 2022, the Embassy was aware of at least three occasions in which sailboats operated by or carrying U.S. citizens were boarded by criminals. The criminals, who have been known to use physical violence, robbed the boats, and in one incident, severely injured the captain when he attempted to fight back. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Visit our website on&#8239;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/internl-maritime-piracy-robbery.html">International Maritime Piracy and Armed Robbery at Sea</a>.</p>
<p><b>Kidnapping</b>&#8239;for ransom or political influence occurs in Papua New Guinea, though foreign nationals are not frequently targeted. In February 2023, a foreign national was kidnapped. In late 2022, foreign nationals employed by an international company were kidnapped and held for several days. &#8239;</p>
<p>Travelers should exercise increased caution when traveling in remote areas of Papua New Guinea due to the presence of&#8239;<b>unexploded ordnance (UXO)</b>&#8239;remaining from the Second World War. UXO is discovered infrequently throughout the country, often on smaller islands.</p>
<p>Papua New Guinea has<b>&#8239;inconsistent availability of healthcare services. &nbsp;</b>Healthcare may be difficult to obtain outside of Port Moresby. &nbsp;Pharmaceuticals may be scarce or unavailable.</p>
<p>Papua New Guinea is subject to periodic seismic activity and is home to several active volcanoes. The country does experience regular volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, and tsunamis. U.S. citizens are advised to familiarize themselves with&#8239;<a href="https://www.usgs.gov/programs/VHP/volcano-updates">volcano updates</a>,&#8239;<a href="https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/map/?extent=-36.10238,-275.09766&amp;extent=28.92163,-157.67578">earthquake tracking</a>, and&#8239;<a href="https://www.tsunami.gov/">tsunami warnings</a>&#8239;in Papua New Guinea. U.S. citizens should develop contingency plans in the event of an eruption or major earthquake. &#8239;</p>

<p>If you decide to travel to Papua New Guinea:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not use local taxis or buses, known as public motor vehicles or PMVs.</li>
<li>Travel with guides from a reputable tour company, particularly if you plan to hike.</li>
<li>Avoid walking or driving at night.</li>
<li>Avoid areas in the vicinity of active volcanoes.</li>
<li>Do not physically resist any robbery attempt.</li>
<li>Avoid demonstrations and crowds.</li>
<li>Do not touch unknown metal objects and avoid traveling off well-used roads, tracks, and paths due to risk of unexploded ordnance.</li>
<li>Bring a sufficient supply of over-the-counter and prescription medicines.</li>
<li>Avoid sailing around the waters of Papua New Guinea and review the&#8239;<a href="https://icc-ccs.org/map/">Live Piracy Report</a>&#8239;published by the International Maritime Bureau.</li>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><b><i>Updated to reflect the end of ordered departure of eligible family members and authorized departure for non-emergency employees and updates to U.S. government employee movement restrictions.</i></b></p>
<p>Reconsider travel to Burundi due to <b>political violence, crime, </b>and<b> health</b>. Some areas have increased risk. Read the entire Travel Advisory.</p>
<p><b>Do Not Travel to</b>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The former Central Market located on Chaussee Prince Louis Rwagasore in Bujumbura due to the risk of <b>violent</b> <b>crime</b>.</li>
<li>Cibitoke and Bubanza provinces and Kibira National Park due to potential <b>armed violence</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Country Summary:</b>&nbsp;The possibility for political violence exists throughout Burundi. Police and military checkpoints are common and can limit movement. Police may search private homes for weapons. The borders may close without notice.</p>
<p>Violent crimes like assault, carjacking, home invasion, grenade attacks, and armed robbery are possible. Criminals may target foreigners and residents suspected of having large sums of cash. Local police lack the resources and training to respond effectively to crimes.</p>
<p>Medical services in Burundi fall well below U.S. standards, and there are no adequate trauma services in the country. Emergency medical and fire services are limited or non-existent in some areas of the country. Even relatively minor health problems may necessitate a medical evacuation at the traveler&#8217;s expense. Medical evacuation insurance valid for travel to Burundi is strongly recommended.</p>
<p>Due to the risks, the U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens throughout Burundi. U.S. Embassy staff are subject to restrictions when traveling in certain areas of Burundi and may be subject to other constraints as security conditions warrant. U.S. government employees working in Burundi are prohibited from travelling outside Bujumbura Mairie during hours of darkness (typically 6:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m.).</p>
<p>Due to the risks, the U.S. government may be unable to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in the following areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>The provinces of Bubanza.</li>
<li>Cibitoke and Kibira National Park (including the park&#8217;s southernmost part in Muramvya province).</li>
</ul>

      <title>Solomon Islands - Level 2: Exercise Increased Caution</title>
      <link>https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/solomon-island-travel-advisory.html</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2025</pubDate>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><b>Reissued after periodic review with updated risk information.<br>
</b>Exercise increased caution traveling to Solomon Islands due to risks to health, unexploded ordinance, crime and civil unrest.</p>
<p><b>Mosquito-borne diseases</b> such as malaria and dengue fever are widespread. Medical facilities and clinics outside of Honiara are under-resourced in terms of drugs and medical equipment.</p>
<p><b>Unexploded ordinance (UXO)</b> from World War II remains a significant hazard and may be present on land, in forests, and underwater locations. Many areas have been swept or cleared, however previously undetected UXO continue to be discovered on a regular basis. While some areas are much more dangerous than others, caution is advised, even in areas reported to be cleared. High-risk areas include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hell&#8217;s Point and the ridges behind Honiara</li>
<li>New Georgia group of islands</li>
<li>Russell Islands</li>
<li>Tulagi Island</li>
</ul>
<p><b>While petty crime is common</b> in some parts of Solomon Islands, Honiara has a higher risk of petty crime, break-ins, robbery, and sexual assault, including incidents targeting foreigners. Travelers should remain vigilant, avoid displaying valuables in public, and be cautious in less populated or poorly lit areas. Other violent crimes are uncommon but can occur.</p>
<p><b>Civil unrest can arise with little notice.</b> Political developments, including Parliament sittings, elections, and times of political uncertainty, may lead to protests or demonstrations, which have the potential to turn violent. Avoid large gatherings and political events.</p>
<p>If you decide to travel to Solomon Islands:</p>
<ul>

      <title>Uganda - Level 3: Reconsider Travel</title>
      <link>https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/uganda-travel-advisory.html</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 23 Apr 2025</pubDate>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><i><b>Updated with information on upcoming national elections and the &#8220;If you decide to travel&#8221; section.</b></i></p>
<p>Reconsider travel to Uganda due to<b> crime, terrorism</b>, and <b>laws targeting persons on the basis of sexual orientation</b>.&nbsp; Exercise increased caution due to potential security risks and the unpredictable nature of <b>public demonstrations</b>. &nbsp;This includes demonstrations by political groups leading up to the January to February 2026 elections. &nbsp;Read the entire Travel Advisory.</p>
<p><b>Country Summary:</b> There remains a threat of <b>terrorist attacks </b>in Uganda. &nbsp;Visit the U.S. Department of State's <a href="https://www.state.gov/country-reports-on-terrorism/">country reports on terrorism</a>&nbsp;to learn more.</p>
<p>Terrorist attacks have targeted:</p>
<ul>
<li>Religious venues</li>
<li>Schools</li>
<li>Government buildings</li>
<li>Police stations</li>
<li>Transportation hubs</li>
<li>Areas visited by tourists.</li>
</ul>
<p>These attacks have resulted in the deaths of Ugandans as well as foreign visitors. &nbsp;U.S. citizens should remain alert and avoid large public gatherings. In 2023, ISIS-Central Africa attacked and claimed responsibility for killing two international tourists and a Ugandan driver within Queen Elizabeth National Park.</p>
<p><b>Violent crime </b>is a real danger in Uganda<b>. </b>It<b> </b>includes armed robbery, home invasion, and sexual assault. &nbsp;Both visitors and residents face these threats. Crime can happen anytime.&nbsp; It is more common in larger cities, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kampala</li>
<li>Jinja</li>
<li>Entebbe</li>
<li>Karamoja region</li>
<li>Along Uganda&#8217;s western and northern borders</li>
</ul>
<p>Police struggle to respond to serious crime in most places due to limited resources.</p>
<p><b>Laws Targeting Persons on the Basis of Sexual Orientation<br>
</b>The 2023 Anti-Homosexuality Act (AHA) applies to both visitors and residents of Uganda. &nbsp;The AHA increases the danger for persons who may be targeted on the basis of their sexual orientation, those seen as or perceived to be lesbian, gay, or bisexual, and those accused of &#8220;promoting homosexuality.&#8221; &nbsp;They could face fines, imprisonment, or the death penalty and may also face harassment, violence, or attacks by vigilantes or mobs.&nbsp; Assault and harassment cases linked to support for lesbian, gay, and bisexual persons have happened across the country.</p>
<p><b>Public Demonstrations<br>
</b>Protests can occur with little to no warning. &nbsp;They often rise around political issues and events, like elections. &nbsp;Primary elections will happen in summer 2025. &nbsp;National elections are set for January to February 2026. &nbsp;When protests, strikes, and demonstrations turn chaotic, security services respond with force. &nbsp;They have used batons, rubber bullets, tear gas, and gunfire to break up the crowds.</p>
<p>Read the <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Uganda.html">country information page</a> for additional information on travel to Uganda.</p>
<p>If you decide to travel to Uganda</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid demonstrations and crowds.</li>
<li>Keep a low profile.</li>
<li>Be aware of your surroundings.</li>
<li>Do not display signs of wealth, such as expensive watches or jewelry, or smartphones.</li>
<li>Use caution when walking or driving at night.</li>
<li>Do not physically resist any robbery attempt.</li>
<li>Do not open your door for people at your hotel or residence unless you know who it is.</li>
<li>Stay alert in locations frequented by foreign tourists.</li>
<li>Be extra vigilant when visiting banks or ATMs.</li>
<li>Enroll in the <a href="https://mytravel.state.gov/s/step">Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP)</a> to receive alerts. &nbsp;It makes it easier to locate you in an emergency.</li>
<li>Be mindful that any public identification with or perception as being lesbian, gay, or bisexual, as either a member or supporter, could be grounds for prosecution, as well as violence.</li>
<li>Remember that even private, consensual same-sex relations are illegal.</li>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><b><i>Reissued after periodic review with minor edits.</i></b></p>
<p>Reconsider travel to Bangladesh due to&nbsp;<b>civil unrest, crime,&nbsp;</b>and&nbsp;<b>terrorism</b>. Some areas have increased risk. Read the entire Travel Advisory.<br>
<br>
<b> Level 4: Do Not Travel</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Khagrachari, Rangamati, and Bandarban Hill Tracts districts (collectively known as the Chittagong Hill Tracts) due to <b>communal violence, crime, terrorism, kidnapping, and other security risks</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Country Summary:&nbsp;</b>Since summer 2024, <b>civil unrest </b>and violent clashes have largely subsided with the formation of the Interim Government.&nbsp; Occasional protests continue with potential for violent clashes. &nbsp;Conditions may change on short notice.&nbsp; U.S. citizens are reminded to avoid all gatherings, even peaceful ones, since they could turn violent with little or no warning.</p>
<p>Travelers should be aware of petty&nbsp;<b>crime,</b>&nbsp;such as pickpocketing in crowded areas. &nbsp;In addition, crimes such as muggings, burglaries, assaults, and illegal drug trafficking constitute most criminal activity in Bangladesh&#8217;s major cities, but there are no indications foreigners are targeted because of their nationality. &nbsp;These crimes tend to be situational, based on time and location.</p>
<p>There is risk of terrorist violence, including terrorist attacks and other activity in Bangladesh.&nbsp; Visit the U.S. Department of State's <a href="https://www.state.gov/country-reports-on-terrorism/">country reports on terrorism</a> to learn more.</p>
<p>Due to the risks, U.S. government employees working in Bangladesh are prohibited from non-essential travel within Dhaka outside of the diplomatic enclave.</p>
<p>Due to the risks, U.S. government employees working in Bangladesh must obtain special authorization to travel outside of Dhaka. Authorization is not required for travel to Cox&#8217;s Bazar or Sylhet.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><b><i>Updated to reflect changes for travelers with dual nationality</i></b></p>
<p>Do not travel to Burkina Faso for any reason due to <b>terrorism, crime,</b> and <b>kidnapping.</b></p>
<p><b>Country Summary:</b> Terrorist organizations continue to plan and conduct terrorist activities throughout Burkina Faso.</p>
<p><b>Terrorism<br>
</b>Terrorists may attack anywhere with little or no warning and may utilize various tactics including the use of common, commercially available items or the use of kidnapping for ransom. Targets may include but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hotels</li>
<li>Restaurants</li>
<li>Police stations</li>
<li>Customs offices</li>
<li>Areas at or near mining sites</li>
<li>Places of worship</li>
<li>Military posts</li>
<li>Schools</li>
</ul>
<p>Visit the U.S. Department of State's <a href="https://www.state.gov/country-reports-on-terrorism/">Country Reports on Terrorism</a> to learn more.</p>
<p>The threat of kidnapping remains persistent throughout Burkina Faso, including in Ouagadougou and especially in the Sahel and East regions.</p>
<p><b>State of Emergency<br>
</b>The Transition Authorities of Burkina Faso have maintained a state of emergency in the following territories:</p>
<ul>
<li>The entire Saheland East regions</li>
<li>The provinces of Kossi and Sourou (Boucle de Mouhoun region)</li>
<li>The province of Kenedougou (Hauts Bassins region)</li>
<li>The province of Loroum (North region)</li>
<li>The province of Koulpelogo (Center-East region)</li>
</ul>
<p>Due to the risks, the U.S. government is unable to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in most of the country. U.S. government employees working in Burkina Faso are prohibited from traveling to regions outside the capital due to security concerns.</p>
<p>Due to a historically high crime rate, the U.S. Embassy discourages U.S. government personnel from nighttime travel to the Balkiui and Rayongo (also known as Dayongo) neighborhoods of Ouagadougou&#8217;s Arrondissement 11.</p>
<p>For travelers with dual nationality, local authorities may not recognize your U.S. nationality if you are also a national of Burkina Faso.

      <description><![CDATA[<p><b><i>Updated to reflect threats against women travelers and increased risks in specific regions. </i></b></p>
<p>Exercise increased caution in Ghana due to&nbsp;<b>crime</b>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<b>violence against women travelers and lesbian, gay, and bisexual travelers</b>.&nbsp; Some areas of Ghana have increased risk. Read the entire Travel Advisory.</p>
<p>Reconsider Travel to:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Upper East Region, North East Region, Upper West Region, and the western portion of the Savannah Region (all areas west of the N12 Highway) that shares a border with Burkina Faso and C&#7897;te d&#8217;Ivoire due to&nbsp;<b>civil unrest </b>and <b>crime.</b></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Country Summary:&nbsp;</b>Violent crimes, such as carjacking, street mugging, assaults, and rape do occur.&nbsp; These crimes often happen at night and in isolated locations.&nbsp; Sexual assault, such as rape, is significantly underreported and remains a serious problem.&nbsp; While domestic violence is criminal under Ghanian law, police rarely respond to reports of domestic violence.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>In urban areas and crowded markets</li>
<li>When traveling by private or public transportation after dark as criminal elements may use blockades to slow down and restrict movement of vehicles</li>
</ul>
<p>Ghanaian law contains prohibitions on &#8220;unnatural carnal knowledge&#8221; &#8211; generally interpreted as any kind of sexual intimacy &#8211; between persons of the same sex, though in practice, the law is largely used to target men.&nbsp; Punishments can include fines and/or incarceration of up to three years.&nbsp; Rhetoric and violence targeting individuals on the basis of sexual orientation have increased in recent years.&nbsp; Individuals have reported safety incidents that include targeted assault, rape, mob attacks, and harassment due to their sexual orientation. </p>

<p>U.S. citizens in Ghana should reconsider travel to the northern border areas near Burkina Faso and C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire due to&nbsp;<b>civil unrest and crime</b>.&nbsp; Due to the risks, U.S. government employees working in Ghana must obtain special authorization to travel to the Upper West Region, the Upper East Region, the North East Region, and the western area of the Savannah Region.&nbsp; The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in these areas.&nbsp; Be sure to read&nbsp;the Burkina Faso Travel Advisory <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/burkina-faso-travel-advisory.html">here</a>.</p>

<li>It suspends several constitutional rights. This includes the normal protections of criminal procedure, like the right to a speedy or fair trial.</li>
<li>Tens of thousands of people are currently in prison under the State of Exception.</li>
<li>Several U.S. and other foreign citizens have been detained under the State of Exception. They remain in prison and have yet to face trial.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Yemen - Level 4: Do Not Travel</title>
      <link>https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/yemen-travel-advisory.html</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 31 Mar 2025</pubDate>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><b><i>Reissued after periodic review with minor edits related to terrorism and security.</i></b><i></i></p>
<p>Do not travel to Yemen due to&nbsp;<b>terrorism, civil unrest, crime, health risks, kidnapping, armed conflict,&nbsp;</b>and<b>&nbsp;landmines</b>.</p>
<p><b>Country Summary:</b>&nbsp;The U.S. Embassy in Sana&#8217;a suspended its operations in February 2015. The U.S. government is unable to provide emergency or routine consular services to U.S. citizens in Yemen. U.S. citizens should not travel to Yemen for any reason.</p>
<p>The Department of State has re-designated Ansarallah (commonly referred to as the Houthis) as a Foreign Terrorist Organization. Other terrorist groups, like Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and Islamic State affiliates, also plan and carry out attacks in Yemen. Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, targeting public sites, transportation hubs, markets, as well as government buildings and facilities. There is also a risk of kidnapping/detention by terrorists, criminals, and other groups or individuals. Foreign workers and employees may be targeted.</p>
<p>A civil war continues in Yemen. Even though violence has decreased since a truce in April 2022, instability and fighting are still common, especially along the front lines in central Yemen. Travelers should not rely on significant assistance from local authorities. Foreigners are frequently targets of kidnapping and carjacking, especially outside of urban areas.</p>
<p>Military conflict has destroyed basic infrastructure like housing, medical facilities, schools, and utilities. This makes it hard to get electricity, clean water, and medical care. Humanitarian groups face obstacles in delivering food, medicine, and water. Landmines are found throughout Yemen.</p>
<p>Violent and organized crime is common in Yemen. Local law enforcement may not be able or willing to respond to serious crimes.</p>
<p>Health services in Yemen are poor. There is a re-emergence of diseases like cholera, polio, and measles, which are spreading, especially in Houthi-controlled areas. Medicine and medical supplies are hard to find. Adequate medical treatment is often not available.</p>
<p>U.S. citizens, especially dual U.S.-Yemeni citizens, are at high risk of kidnapping and detention in Yemen. U.S. citizens, particularly young people, may be kidnapped for forced marriage. These often involve family members in the United States and/or Yemen. The Houthis, who control Sana&#8217;a, have detained U.S. citizens, including those with dual citizenship. U.S. citizens have faced difficulty and delays when trying to leave Yemen.</p>
<p>Some companies outside Yemen have misrepresented the safety of the Yemeni island of Socotra. They offer tourist trips with unofficial and invalid &quot;visas.&quot; These companies put tourists in danger and legal jeopardy. Only the Republic of Yemen government can issue valid Yemeni visas. The U.S. government cannot assist U.S. citizens in Socotra. Do not travel to Socotra or any part of Yemen.</p>
<p>Limited commercial flights are available from Aden and Sana&#8217;a to other airports in the region. Check with airlines and travel companies for the latest flight information.</p>
<p>Due to risks to civil aviation operating within or in the vicinity of Yemen, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) and a Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR). For more information, U.S. citizens should consult the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions/">Federal Aviation Administration&#8217;s Prohibitions, Restrictions, and Notices</a>.</p>
<p>Due to risks to commercial shipping operating within or in the vicinity of Yemen territorial waters, the Department of Transportation&#8217;s Maritime Administration (MARAD) has issued a Maritime Advisory. For more information, U.S. citizens should consult the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci/maritime-security-communications-industry-msci-web-portal">Maritime Administration&#8217;s Maritime Security Communications with Industry (MSCI)</a>.</p>
<p>The U.S. Coast Guard has determined that effective anti-terrorism measures are not in place in Yemen ports and has imposed conditions of entry on vessels that arrive in U.S. ports having visited ports in Yemen. Mariners and passengers traveling through the ports of Yemen should exercise caution.</p>
<p>Read the&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Yemen.html">country information page</a>&nbsp;for additional information on travel to Yemen.</p>
<p>If, despite this Travel Advisory, you decide to travel to Yemen:</p>
<ul>
<li>Visit our website for&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/go/TraveltoHighRiskAreas.html">Travel to High-Risk Areas</a>.</li>
<li>Bring enough supply of over-the-counter and prescription medicines.</li>
<li>Have evacuation plans that do not rely on U.S. government assistance.</li>
<li>Draft a will and designate appropriate insurance beneficiaries or power of attorney.</li>
<li>Make a plan with loved ones regarding care/custody of children, pets, property, belongings, non-liquid assets (collections, artwork, etc.), funeral wishes, etc.</li>
<li>Share important documents, login information, and points of contact with loved ones. This is so that they can manage your affairs if you are unable to return as planned to the United States. Review this <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-checklist.html/">list</a> of documents to prepare for your trip.</li>
<li>Stay aware of your surroundings.</li>
<li>Consider hiring a professional security organization.</li>
<li>Develop a communication plan with family, or your employer or host organization (if you are traveling on business). This is so that they can monitor your safety and location as you travel through high-risk areas. Specify how you&#8217;ll confirm you&#8217;re safe (texts, calls, etc.), how often, and who you&#8217;ll contact first to share the information.</li>
<li>Appoint one family member to serve as the point of contact if you are taken hostage or detained. Set up a proof-of-life protocol. If you become a hostage, that person will know what questions to ask and answers to expect. This will help them be sure that you are alive (and to rule out a hoax).</li>
<li>Leave DNA samples with your medical provider in case it is necessary for your family to access them.</li>
<li>Enroll in the&nbsp;<a href="https://step.state.gov/step/">Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP)</a>&nbsp;to receive messages and Alerts from the U.S. Embassy and make it easier to locate you in an emergency.</li>

      <title>Iran - Level 4: Do Not Travel</title>
      <link>https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/iran-travel-advisory.html</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 31 Mar 2025</pubDate>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><b><i>Updated to reflect changes to the &#8220;If you decide to travel to Iran&#8221; section, add warnings about Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) and surrogacy, and updated information on detention risks.</i></b></p>
<p>Do not travel to Iran due to the risk of <b>terrorism, civil unrest, kidnapping, arbitrary arrest of U.S. citizens,</b> and<b> wrongful detention.</b></p>
<p><b>Country Summary: </b>Do not travel to Iran for any reason.<b>&nbsp;</b>U.S. citizens in Iran face serious dangers. They have been kidnapped and wrongfully arrested. Some have been held for years on false charges, subjected to psychological torture, and even sentenced to death. The U.S. government does not have diplomatic or consular relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran. The Swiss government, acting through its Embassy in Tehran, serves as the protecting power for United States interests in Iran.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Department of State has determined that U.S. nationals traveling to Iran are at significant risk of wrongful detention. &nbsp;Iranian authorities continue to unjustly detain U.S. nationals without warning or any evidence they committed a crime. &nbsp;This includes dual U.S.-Iranian nationals, students, journalists, business travelers, academics, and individuals with U.S. military or government experience. &nbsp;Charges include espionage and posing a threat to national security. &nbsp;U.S. nationals are at significant risk of questioning, arrest, and detention in Iran.&nbsp; Having a U.S. passport or connections to the United States can be reason enough for Iranian authorities to detain someone.</p>
<p>Iranian authorities routinely delay consular access to detained U.S. nationals. &nbsp;In particular, Iranian authorities consistently deny consular access to dual U.S.-Iranian nationals.</p>
<p><b>Terrorism</b></p>
<p>Violent extremist groups, including U.S. government-designated terrorist organizations, operate in Iran.&nbsp; ISIS and related groups have taken responsibility for bombings and other attacks in the country.&nbsp; The risk of terrorism and deadly harm to bystanders continues.</p>
<p><b>Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) and Surrogacy</b></p>
<p>Companies offering surrogacy services in Iran are grossly misrepresenting the security situation in Iran and risks of the unregulated surrogacy tourism industry.&nbsp; Private companies that organize these visits and services put U.S. citizens in danger.&nbsp; Iranian surrogacy providers have also been known to misrepresent U.S. citizenship law; if a child born overseas to a surrogate is not genetically or gestationally related to a U.S. citizen parent or the spouse of a U.S. citizen, the child will not automatically acquire U.S. citizenship at birth and will not be able to obtain a U.S. passport to leave Iran.</p>
<p><b>Aviation Safety Oversight</b></p>
<p>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) and a Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR) that bans U.S. flights to, from, or through Iran&#8217;s airspace.&nbsp; This is due to risks to civil aviation operating within or near Iran. &nbsp;&nbsp;U.S. citizens should consult the <a href="https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions">Federal Aviation Administration&#8217;s Prohibitions, Restrictions and Notices for more information</a>.</p>
<p>Read the <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Iran.html">country information page</a> for additional information on travel to Iran.</p>
<p><b>If you decide to travel to Iran:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Review your personal security plan and visit our website for&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/high-risk-travelers.html">Travel to High-Risk Areas</a>.</li>
<li>Consider the risks involved in having dual U.S.-Iranian nationality.</li>
<li>Draft a will and designate appropriate insurance beneficiaries or power of attorney.</li>
<li>Leave DNA samples with your medical provider in case it is necessary for your loved ones to access them.</li>
<li>Establish a proof of life protocol with your loved ones.&nbsp; This is so that if you are taken hostage, your loved ones know specific questions (and answers) to ask the hostage-takers to be sure that you are alive (and to rule out a hoax).</li>
<li>Share important documents, login information, and points of contact with loved ones.&nbsp; This is so that they can manage your affairs if you are unable to return as planned to the United States.&nbsp; Review this <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-checklist.html">list</a> of documents to prepare for your trip.</li>
<li>Check local media for breaking events.&nbsp; Be prepared to adjust your plans.</li>
<li>Have a plan for departing Iran that does not rely on U.S. government help.</li>
<li>Enroll in the <a href="https://step.state.gov/">Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP)</a> to receive alerts from the Department. It makes it easier to locate you in an emergency.</li>

      <pubDate>Mon, 17 Mar 2025</pubDate>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><b><i>Updated to include a risk indicator for health and to reflect additional safety and security information.</i></b></p>
<p><b>Do Not Travel to:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Kenya-Somalia border counties (Garissa, Wajir, Mandera), Tana River County, and coastal areas north of Malindi due to&nbsp;<b>terrorism</b>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<b>kidnapping;</b></li>
<li>West Pokot and western Turkana County due to&nbsp;<b>banditry;</b></li>
<li>Parts of Marsabit and Turkana Counties within 30 miles (50 kilometers) of the Ethiopian border due to <b>cross-border incursions.</b></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Reconsider Travel to:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Nairobi neighborhoods of Eastleigh and Kibera due to&nbsp;<b>crime&nbsp;</b>and&nbsp;<b>kidnapping</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Country Summary:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Violent crime, such as armed carjacking, mugging, home invasion, and kidnapping, can occur at any time. Local police often lack the capability to respond effectively to serious crimes and terrorist attacks.&nbsp; Emergency medical and fire services are limited. Avoid traveling after dark in Kenya due to crime and poor traffic safety.</p>
<p><b>Crime<br>
</b>Motorycle crimes are common, where thieves grab items from victims and are able to quickly flee the scene. Crimes typically occur in crowded areas or when people are distracted. Police have limited ability to respond to these crimes. &nbsp;Handbags, mobile phones, and other easy-to-reach valuables are the most stolen items.</p>
<p><b>Terrorism<br>
</b>Terrorist attacks have occurred with little or no warning. They have targeted:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kenyan and foreign government buildings,</li>
<li>Tourist locations,</li>
<li>Transportation hubs,</li>
<li>Hotels and resorts,</li>
<li>Markets and shopping malls, and</li>
<li>Places of worship.</li>
</ul>
<p>Terrorist acts have included armed assaults, suicide operations, bomb or grenade attacks, and kidnappings.</p>
<p><b>Demonstrations<br>
</b>Demonstrations, strikes, and other political and economic protests are common. They often block key intersections or highways, resulting in widespread traffic jams. Violence during demonstrations has occurred across the country. This includes rock-throwing and police using deadly force. Political violence is most common in western Kenya and Nairobi.</p>
<p><b>Health&nbsp;<br>
</b>Access to medical care in Kenya is limited and medical facilities may not have adequate supply of medicine, especially outside large cities. Medical evacuation insurance valid for travel to Kenya is strongly recommended. Hospitals usually require payment before treatment.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Unlicensed facilities and bribes<br>
</b>Some schools and behavior modification facilities in Kenya operate without licensing and oversight. Reports of U.S. citizens being held against their will or being physically abused in these facilities are common. The embassy has also received numerous reports from young adults whose U.S. passports were taken away by their families.</p>
<p>The embassy frequently receives complaints from U.S. citizens about being stopped by police or immigration or customs officials asking for bribes.</p>
<p><b>Property confiscations<br>
</b>Property disputes are common and can turn violent. Some U.S. citizens have had their property confiscated or been threatened.</p>

<ul>

      <title>South Sudan - Level 4: Do Not Travel</title>
      <link>https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/south-sudan-travel-advisory.html</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 08 Mar 2025</pubDate>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><b><i>Updated to reflect changes to security information.</i></b></p>
<p>Do not travel to South Sudan due to&nbsp;<b>crime</b>, <b>kidnapping</b>,&nbsp;and&nbsp;<b>armed conflict</b>.</p>
<p><b>Country Summary:</b>&nbsp;Armed conflict is ongoing and includes fighting between various political and ethnic groups. Weapons are readily available to the population. In addition, cattle raids occur throughout the country and often lead to violence.</p>
<p>Violent crime, such as carjackings, shootings, ambushes, assaults, robberies, and kidnappings are common throughout South Sudan, including Juba. Foreign nationals have been the victims of rape, sexual assault, armed robberies, and other violent crimes.</p>
<p>Reporting in South Sudan without the proper documentation from the South Sudanese Media Authority is considered illegal, and any journalistic work there is very dangerous. Journalists regularly report being harassed in South Sudan, and many have been killed while covering the conflict.</p>
<p>The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency consular services to U.S. citizens in South Sudan. U.S. government personnel working in South Sudan are under a strict curfew. They must use armored vehicles for nearly all movements, and official travel outside Juba is limited. Due to the critical crime threat in Juba, walking is also restricted; when allowed, it is limited to a small area in the immediate vicinity of the Embassy and during daylight hours only. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) and/or a Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR). This is due to risks to civil aviation operating within or in the vicinity of South Sudan. For more information U.S. citizens should consult the <a href="https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions">Federal Aviation Administration&#8217;s Prohibitions, Restrictions and Notices.</a> Read the&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/SouthSudan.html">country information page</a>&nbsp;for additional information on travel to South Sudan.</p>
<p><b>If you decide to travel to South Sudan:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Exercise extreme care in all parts of the country, including Juba. Travel outside of Juba with a minimum of two vehicles along with appropriate recovery and medical equipment in case of mechanical failure or other emergency.</li>
<li>Avoid travel along border areas.</li>
<li>Avoid demonstrations and crowds.</li>
<li>Be aware that photography in public is strictly controlled, and you are required to obtain authorization from the Ministry of Information before taking any photographs or video in public &#8211; including while inside a vehicle.</li>
<li>Check local media for breaking news. Be prepared to adjust your plans.</li>
<li>We highly recommend that you buy insurance before you travel. Check with your <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html">travel insurance provider</a> about evacuation assistance, medical insurance, and trip cancellation coverage.</li>
<li>Enroll in the <a href="https://usdos.sharepoint.com/sites/CA-Clearance/ClearanceDocuments2025/T0595-25/STEP.STATE.GOV">Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP)</a> to receive messages and Alerts from the U.S. Embassy and make it easier to locate you in an emergency.</li>
<li>Review your personal security plan and visit our page on travel to <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/high-risk-travelers.html">high risk areas</a>.</li>
<li>Draft a will and designate appropriate insurance beneficiaries and/or power of attorney.</li>
<li>Discuss a plan with loved ones regarding care/custody of children, pets, property, belongings, non-liquid assets (collections, artwork, etc.), funeral wishes, etc.</li>
<li>Share important documents, login information, and points of contact with loved ones. This is so that they can manage your affairs if you are unable to return as planned to the United States. Review this <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-checklist.html/">list</a> of documents to prepare for your trip</li>
<li>Establish your own personal security plan in coordination with your employer or host organization, or consider consulting with a professional security organization. Your plan should include sheltering in place, maintaining outside communication, and a personal evacuation plan via commercial means.</li>
<li>Develop a communication plan with family or your employer or host organization (if you are traveling on business). This is so that they can monitor your safety and location as you travel through high-risk areas. Specify how you'll confirm you're safe (text, calls, etc.), how often, and who you'll contact first to share the information.</li>
<li>Choose one family member to serve as the point of contact. They will communicate with kidnappers/hostage-takers, media, U.S. and host country government agencies, and members of Congress if you are kidnapped or taken hostage.</li>
<li>Establish a proof of life protocol with your loved ones. This is so that if you are taken hostage, your loved ones can know specific questions (and answers) to ask the hostage-takers to be sure that you are alive (and to rule out a hoax).</li>
<li>Leave DNA samples with your medical provider in case it is necessary for your family to access them.</li>
<li>Erase any sensitive photos, comments, or other materials from your social media pages, cameras, laptops, and other electronic devices that could be considered controversial or provocative by local groups.</li>
<li>Leave your expensive/sentimental belongings behind.</li>
<li>Review the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.osac.gov/Content/Browse/Report?subContentTypes=Country%20Security%20Report">Country Security Report</a>&nbsp;for South Sudan.</li>
<li>U.S. citizens who travel abroad should always have a contingency plan for emergency situations. Review the&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-checklist.html">Traveler&#8217;s Checklist</a>.</li>

      <title>Pakistan - Level 3: Reconsider Travel</title>
      <link>https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/pakistan-travel-advisory.html</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 07 Mar 2025</pubDate>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><b><i>Reissued after periodic review with minor edits.</i></b></p>
<p>Reconsider travel to Pakistan due to<b>&#8239;terrorism </b>and<b> the potential for armed conflict</b>. &nbsp;Some areas have increased risk. &nbsp;Read the entire Travel Advisory.</p>
<p>Do Not Travel to:&#8239;</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Balochistan Province</b> and <b>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) Province</b>, which include the former Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), due to&nbsp;<b>terrorism.</b></li>
<li>The <b>immediate vicinity of the India-Pakistan border</b> and the <b>Line of Control</b> due to&#8239;<b>terrorism</b>&#8239;and&#8239;<b>the potential for armed</b>&nbsp;<b>conflict</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Country Summary:</b>&nbsp;Violent extremist groups continue to plot attacks in Pakistan. &nbsp;Terrorist attacks are frequent in Balochistan Province and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province (KP), which include the former FATA.&nbsp; Large-scale terrorist attacks have resulted in numerous casualties, and small-scale attacks are frequent. &nbsp;Terrorism and ongoing violence by extremist elements have led to indiscriminate attacks on civilian, as well as local military and police targets. &nbsp;Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, targeting transportation hubs, markets, shopping malls, military installations, airports, universities, tourist attractions, schools, hospitals, places of worship, and government facilities. &nbsp;Terrorists have targeted U.S. diplomats and diplomatic facilities in the past.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Local law prohibits protesting or demonstrating without a permit. &nbsp;Being near a protest can draw scrutiny from Pakistani security forces. &nbsp;U.S. citizens have been detained for participating in protests and for posting content on social media perceived as critical of the Pakistani government, military, or officials. &nbsp;Internet and mobile phone service outages are common, especially during protests.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pakistan&#8217;s security environment remains fluid, sometimes changing with little or no notice. &nbsp;There are greater security resources and infrastructure in the major cities, particularly Islamabad, and security forces in these areas may be more readily able to respond to an emergency compared to other areas of the country.</p>
<p>The government of Pakistan restricts the travel of U.S. government personnel working in Pakistan. &nbsp;The U.S. government has limited ability to provide services to U.S. citizens in the KP Province, Balochistan Province, Pakistan-administered Azad Kashmir, and most areas outside of Islamabad, Lahore, and Karachi.&nbsp; Due to the risks, U.S. government personnel working in Pakistan must obtain special authorization to travel to most areas outside of Islamabad, Lahore, and Karachi. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The U.S. Embassy and Consulates require U.S. government personnel to use armed escorts and armored vehicles when traveling in certain parts of the country, both for official and personal travel. &nbsp;Additional restrictions on movements can occur suddenly and at any time, depending on local circumstances and security conditions. &nbsp;U.S. government personnel on assignment in Pakistan are prohibited from attending most large gatherings.</p>
<p>The U.S. Embassy and Consulates have a limited ability to provide consular services to dual U.S.-Pakistani citizens who have been arrested or detained. Pakistani law considers such individuals to be <b>exclusively citizens of Pakistan</b>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The U.S. Consulate General in Peshawar does not provide consular services.&nbsp; Services for U.S. citizens are available from the U.S. Embassy in Islamabad, the U.S. Consulate General in Karachi, and the U.S. Consulate General in Lahore.</p>
<p>Read the&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Pakistan.html">country information page</a>&nbsp;for additional information on travel to Pakistan.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Country Summary:</b>&nbsp;Do not attempt to enter the United Nations buffer zone at any place other than a designated crossing point. Police and UN peacekeeping forces strictly enforce this restriction.</p>

<p><b>Turkish Cypriot-Administered Area &#8211; Exercise increased caution</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>The U.S. Embassy in Nicosia has limited ability to assist U.S. citizens in this area.</b></li>
<li><b>Human rights reports show that central prison and police detention facilities in this area do not meet international standards.</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Since 1974, the southern part of Cyprus has been under the control of the internationally recognized Government of the Republic of Cyprus. The northern part of Cyprus, administered by Turkish Cypriots, proclaimed itself the &#8220;Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus&#8221; (&#8220;TRNC&#8221;) in 1983. The United States does not recognize the &#8220;TRNC,&#8221; nor does any country other than T&#252;rkiye. A buffer zone, patrolled by the UN Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus, separates the two sides. For U.S. citizen travelers:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Enter and exit the island of Cyprus ONLY&nbsp;</b>at Larnaca and Paphos airports or at the seaports of Limassol, Larnaca, and Paphos. The Republic of Cyprus&nbsp;<b>does not consider</b>&nbsp;entry via Ercan Airport or by a seaport in the north to be a legal entrance or departure to Cyprus. U.S. citizens who depart the island from Ercan could have difficulty returning to the Republic of Cyprus in the future.</li>
<li>You&nbsp;<b>cannot receive a residency permit</b>&nbsp;from the Republic of Cyprus to reside in the area administered by Turkish Cypriots.</li>
<li>The Republic of Cyprus <b>does not recognize</b>&nbsp;residence permits issued by Turkish Cypriots. If you arrive to the island at a north seaport or Ercan airport or stay in the Turkish Cypriot-administered area for over 90 days, you might be subsequently denied entry into the Republic of Cyprus.</li>
<li>The U.S. Embassy has limited ability to help U.S. citizens in need of assistance in the area administered by Turkish Cypriots as the government of the Republic of Cyprus does not control the area. Travelers should factor this consideration into their activities in this area.</li>

      <title>Afghanistan - Level 4: Do Not Travel</title>
      <link>https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/afghanistan-advisory.html</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 13 Jan 2025</pubDate>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><b><i>Reissued after periodic review with updates to reflect the security environment, immigration information, and availability of medical care.</i></b></p>
<p>Do not travel to Afghanistan due to <b>civil unrest, crime, terrorism, risk of wrongful detention, kidnapping, and limited health facilities.</b></p>
<p><b>Country Summary:</b> The U.S. Embassy in Kabul suspended operations in 2021. The U.S. government is not able to provide routine or emergency consular services to U.S. citizens in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Multiple terrorist groups are active in Afghanistan and U.S. citizens are targets of kidnapping and hostage-taking. The Taliban have harassed and detained aid and humanitarian workers. The activities of foreigners may be viewed with suspicion, and reasons for detention may be unclear. Even if you are registered with the appropriate authorities to conduct business, the risk of detention is high.<br>
</p>
<p>The Department has determined there is a risk of wrongful detention of U.S. nationals in Afghanistan. Additionally, Afghan-U.S. citizens and U.S. Lawful Permanent Residents (LPRs) who previously supported the United States (for example, as an interpreter) in Afghanistan may be targeted for detention.</p>
<p>The Taliban do not regularly permit the United States to conduct welfare checks on U.S. citizens in detention, including by phone. Detention can be lengthy. While in detention, U.S. citizens have limited or no access to medical attention and may be subject to physical abuse.</p>
<p>U.S. citizens should not travel to Afghanistan for any reason, including to accompany eligible family members for relocation. U.S. citizens or LPRs do not have to be physically present in Afghanistan for their qualifying family members to receive such assistance. For further information on how to assist your family members with the <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/immigrate/family-immigration.html">immigrant visa application process</a> or to request relocation assistance for family, please refer to our <a href="https://www.state.gov/afghanistan-family-reunification/">website</a>.</p>
<p>U.S. citizens in Afghanistan are urged to depart immediately via commercial means if possible. U.S. citizens who are seeking U.S. government assistance to depart should email complete biographic details and contact information (email and phone number), as well as U.S.<i> </i>passport number, to <a href="mailto:AfghanistanACS@state.gov">AfghanistanACS@state.gov</a>.</p>
<p>Basic medical care is available in major Afghan cities such as Kabul but is limited in rural areas.</p>
<p>Read the&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Afghanistan.html">country information page</a>&nbsp;for additional information on travel to Afghanistan.</p>
<p>If you choose to disregard the Travel Advisory and travel to Afghanistan:</p>
<ul>
<li>Review your personal security plans.</li>
<li>Be aware of your surroundings and local security developments at all times.</li>
<li>Keep a low profile.</li>
<li>Monitor local media for breaking events and be prepared to adjust your plans.</li>
<li>Keep travel documents up to date and easily accessible.</li>
<li>Notify a trusted person of your travel and movement plans.</li>
<li>Make contingency plans to leave when it is safe to do so that do not rely on U.S. government assistance.</li>
<li>Draft a will and designate appropriate insurance beneficiaries and/or power of attorney.</li>
<li>Discuss a plan with loved ones regarding care/custody of children, pets, property, belongings, non-liquid assets (collections, artwork, etc.), funeral wishes, etc.</li>
<li>Leave DNA samples with your medical provider in case it is necessary for your family to access them.</li>

      <title>Guatemala - Level 3: Reconsider Travel</title>
      <link>https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/guatemala-travel-advisory.html</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 30 Dec 2024</pubDate>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><b><i>Reissued after periodic review with minor edits.</i></b></p>
<p>Reconsider travel to Guatemala due to<b>&nbsp;crime</b>. Some areas have higher risks. Please read the full Travel Advisory.</p>
<p>Do not travel to:</p>
<ul>
<li>San Marcos Department (except the city of San Marcos) due to&nbsp;<b>crime</b>.</li>
<li>Huehuetenango Department (except the city of Huehuetenango) due to&nbsp;<b>crime</b>.</li>
<li>Zone 18&nbsp;in Guatemala City and the city of Villa Nueva due to&nbsp;<b>crime</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Country Summary:</b>&nbsp;Some areas of Guatemala have problems with gangs, robbery, carjacking, drug trafficking and violence. Local law enforcement may not always respond well to serious crimes, leading to low arrest and conviction rates. &nbsp;While tourists are not usually targeted, they can still be victims of opportunistic crimes.</p>
<p>Guatemala has a program called the <a href="https://asistur.gt/en/">Tourist Assistance Program</a> (<a href="https://asistur.gt/en/">ASISTUR</a>) that helps protect tourists. ASISTUR works with tourist police (DISETUR) in popular areas like Antigua, Lake Atitl&#225;n, Tikal, Quetzaltenango, Puerto Barrios, and Coban. They also have an emergency call center that speaks both Spanish and English. Tourist groups can request a security escort if they have safety concerns. You can call them anytime by dialing 1500 from a Guatemalan phone number or (502) 2290-2810, and you can also reach them on WhatsApp at +502-5188-1819.</p>
<p>U.S. government employees and their families cannot travel to the San Marcos Department, Huehuetenango Department, Zone 18 in Guatemala City, or Villa Nueva. They can travel to other parts of Guatemala and visit popular places like Tikal, Antigua, Lake Atitl&#225;n, and the Pacific coast areas in the Santa Rosa and Escuintla. However, they should avoid driving outside Guatemala City at night because of poor lighting and safety risks. They may not use white car taxis or public transportation, like &#8220;chicken buses&#8221; due to the high chance of crime and injury.</p>
<p>Check the&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Guatemala.html">country information page</a>&nbsp;for helpful information about traveling to Guatemala. This includes information on entry and exit rules, safety, local laws, health, and getting around. Also, visit the <a href="https://gt.usembassy.gov/services/">U.S. Embassy in Guatemala City</a>&#8217;s website for local resources, like legal help, medical services, driver&#8217;s licenses, and information on residence and work permits, as well as rules about bringing weapons into Guatemala.</p>
<p>If you decide to travel to Guatemala:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not travel outside Guatemala City at night because the roads are poorly lit, and there is a high risk for serious traffic accidents.</li>
<li>When visiting Lake Atitl&#225;n, use certified tour guides and travel between villages by chartered boat. The paths around the lake can be dangerous and hard to access. Emergency services cannot arrive quickly to help.</li>
<li>Avoid swimming in the Pacific Ocean because the currents and undertow are very strong, and there are not many lifeguards.</li>
<li>Never leave drinks unattended in bars and restaurants and say no to invitations from strangers to private parties.</li>
<li>Consider staying in hotels that have secure parking, doormen, and professional security staff.</li>
<li>Use trusted taxi services like Taxis Amarillo Express, Taxi Seguro, or Uber, and only use INGUAT-approved taxis from the &#8220;SAFE&#8221; stand at the airport, hotel taxis, or vetted private drivers. Avoid public transport and white car taxis, as well as &#8220;chicken buses.&#8221;</li>
<li>Do not hike trails or volcanoes without a qualified local guide, as robberies can happen and getting help can be difficult.</li>
<li>Avoid using public ATMs, and do not show signs of wealth like wearing expensive watches or jewelry. Also, try not to use your phone in public.</li>
<li>Check the&nbsp;Overseas Security Advisory Council&#8217;s (OSAC) <a href="https://www.osac.gov/Content/Report/2013f384-296b-4394-bfcb-1c9c40b9c7df">Country Security Report</a>&nbsp;for Guatemala.</li>
<li>Review the&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/go/checklist.html">Traveler&#8217;s Checklist</a> and make a plan for emergencies.</li>
<li>Visit the CDC page for the latest&nbsp;<a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/guatemala?s_cid=ncezid-dgmq-travel-single-001">Travel Health Notice</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2024/itineraries/guatemala-and-belize">Yellow Book</a> on Guatemala.</li>
<li>Sign up for the&nbsp;<a href="https://step.state.gov/">Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP)</a>&nbsp;to receive alerts while in Guatemala and help others find you in case of an emergency.</li>
<li>Follow the U.S. Embassy in Guatemala on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/Embajada.EEUU.Guatemala/">Facebook</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/usembassyguate">X(Twitter)</a> for updates.</li>

</b>Exercise increased caution in Belize due to<b>&nbsp;crime</b>. Some areas have increased risk. Please read the entire Travel Advisory.</p>
<p><b>Country Summary</b>: Violent crime &#8211; such as sexual assault, home invasions, armed robberies, and murder &#8211; are common even during the day and in tourist areas. A significant portion of violent crime is gang related. Due to high crime, travelers are advised to exercise caution while traveling to the south side of Belize City. Local police lack the resources and training to respond effectively to serious crimes. Most crimes remain unresolved and unprosecuted.&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>Be aware of your surroundings.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Avoid walking or driving at night.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Do not physically resist any robbery attempt.&nbsp;</li>

<p><b>Belize City &#8211; Level 3: Reconsider Travel</b></p>
<p>U.S. citizens should avoid traveling to Belize City. Historically much of the violent crime in Belize occurs in the Southside of Belize City and is gang related. This area (south of Haulover Creek Canal and continuing south to Fabers Road) does not overlap with the typical tourism areas. All visitors should maintain an elevated level of situational awareness, exercise increased caution, and practice good safety and security practices.</p>]]></description>

      <link>https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/central-african-republic-travel-advisory.html</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 26 Dec 2024</pubDate>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><b><i>Updated with additional detail about multiple risks and addition of the health indicator.</i></b></p>
<p>Do not travel to the Central African Republic (CAR) due to <b>armed conflict</b>, <b>crime</b>, <b>civil unrest</b>, and <b>kidnapping</b>, as well as Embassy Bangui&#8217;s limited capacity to provide support to U.S. citizens.</p>
<p><b>Country Summary:&nbsp;</b>Although there have been no specific incidents of violence or threats targeting U.S. citizens, there is a continuing risk of civil unrest, demonstrations, and election-related violence (including renewed outbreaks of armed conflict) occurring throughout the country, including the capital of Bangui.</p>
<p>Violent crime, including homicide, kidnapping, armed robbery, aggravated battery, and larceny, is common.</p>
<p>Armed groups and opposition forces control large areas of the country, and they regularly kidnap, injure, and/or kill civilians. In the event of unrest, airport, land border crossings, and road closures may occur with little or no notice.</p>
<p>The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in CAR; U.S. government employees must obtain special authorization to travel outside of the capital. Family members cannot accompany U.S. government employees who work in CAR.</p>
<p>Access to medical care is limited. Medical facilities are limited in the quality and standard of care they can provide, and they may not have adequate supplies of basic medications. Visit our website for <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/go/TraveltoHighRiskAreas.html">Travel to High-Risk Areas</a>.</p>
<p>Read the <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/CentralAfricanRepublic.html">Country Information Page</a> for additional information on travel to CAR.</p>
<p>If you decide to travel to CAR:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Enroll your trip in the State Department's <a href="https://step.state.gov/step/">Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP)</a>.</li>
<li>Draft a will and designate appropriate insurance beneficiaries and/or power of attorney.</li>
<li>Discuss a plan with loved ones regarding care/custody of children, pets, property, belongings, non-liquid assets (collections, artwork, etc.), funeral wishes, etc.</li>
<li>Share important documents, login information, and points of contact with loved ones so that they can manage your affairs, if you are unable to return as planned to the United States. <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-checklist.html/">Find a suggested list of such documents here</a>.</li>
<li>Be sure to appoint one family member to serve as the point of contact with hostage-takers, media, U.S. and host country government agencies, and Members of Congress, if you are taken hostage or detained.</li>
<li>Establish a proof of life protocol with your loved ones, so that if you are taken hostage, your loved ones can know specific questions (and answers) to ask the hostage-takers to be sure that you are alive (and to rule out a hoax).</li>
<li>Leave DNA samples with your medical provider in case it is necessary for your family to access them.</li>
<li>Erase any sensitive photos, comments, or other materials from your social media pages, cameras, laptops, and other electronic devices that could be considered controversial or provocative by local groups.</li>
<li>Leave your expensive/sentimental belongings behind.</li>
<li>While travel medical insurance is recommended for all travelers, local medical facilities are likely to require full payment in cash at the time of service and may otherwise deny care.</li>
<li>Travelers to CAR should have medical evacuation insurance.</li>

<p>In Northwest and Southwest Regions, armed clashes between separatists and government forces, and other acts of violence, including violent criminality, kidnapping for ransom, sexual assault, arson, roadside ambushes and robberies, use of improvised explosive devices, illegitimate detentions, and murder have occurred. Security force operations, curfews and movement restrictions, and attacks by armed militants can take place at any time throughout these regions, including in urban areas. Ongoing violence has led to a breakdown in order and a significant decline in public services, including medical resources in large areas of both regions.</p>

      <title>Nicaragua - Level 3: Reconsider Travel</title>
      <link>https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/nicaragua-travel-advisory.html</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 13 Dec 2024</pubDate>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><i><b>Reissued with updates to information on arbitrary enforcement of laws.</b></i></p>
<p>Reconsider travel to Nicaragua due to&#8239;<b>arbitrary enforcement of laws</b>, <b>the risk of wrongful detention</b>, <b>and limited healthcare availability</b>. Exercise increased caution in Nicaragua due to<b>&#8239;crime</b>.</p>
<p><b>Country Summary:</b> The Government of Nicaragua targets individuals and organizations for political purposes. These include:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>NGO workers,</li>
<li>Academics and students,<br>
</li>
<li>Business representatives,</li>
<li>Civil society leaders,<br>
</li>
<li>Religious and charity workers (including foreign missionaries),<br>
</li>
<li>Journalists,</li>
<li>And many others.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the past year, the Government of Nicaragua has subjected U.S. citizens to arbitrary entry and exit bans, expulsions, arrests, revocations of Nicaraguan citizenship, and other actions.</p>
<p>The Government of Nicaragua may:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Arbitrarily deny entry or re-entry to Nicaragua or departure from Nicaragua to U.S. citizens and Nicaraguan citizens. This includes entry by air or land. Travel refunds are NOT provided in these cases. Denials and exit bans can occur for political reasons. This includes perceived support for or association with those the government disfavors. <b>The government is not required to provide a basis for its denial</b>.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Search personal phones, computers, social media accounts, and documents for anti-government content.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Limit photography.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Seize personal devices.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Target individuals for political reasons, regardless of nationality. These can include former allies, political activists, business representatives, religious and charity groups, clergy, missionaries, human rights advocates, civil society leaders, academics, and journalists.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Target pro-democracy advocates and their family members.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Confiscate privately-owned land, residences, financial assets, or personal property. They may do this without warning or due process.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Arbitrarily detain, accuse, and charge individuals with terrorism, money laundering, or organized crime offenses. They may do this without fair or transparent processes.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><b>The Department has determined there is a risk of wrongful detention of U.S. nationals by the Government of Nicaragua</b>. U.S. citizens should reconsider travel to Nicaragua, including to work for or volunteer with non-profits or religious organizations. Since 2018, the Government of Nicaragua has closed more than 5,300 civil society organizations, including religious organizations. Nicaraguan security services have arrested U.S. citizens on false charges. This includes dual U.S.-Nicaraguan citizens. Those arrested can be denied fair and transparent treatment. Convictions routinely occur in non-public trials without adequate defense or credible evidence. Nicaraguan authorities also arbitrarily enforce laws against U.S. citizen religious workers. Nicaraguan authorities have conducted questionable criminal investigations against U.S. citizens engaged in religious activity. U.S. citizens arrested in Nicaragua may be detained for long periods without charges. Judicial processes often lack transparency. This is especially true in politically motivated arrests and property disputes. Political objectives and pressure may affect the willingness of a local attorney to assist and impact the outcomes of legal processes. Prison conditions can be harsh and life-threatening.</p>
<p>Managua has a sole private hospital that is JCAHO (Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations) accredited and certified, with labs and radiology services available, though it has a very limited number of specialists for acute emergencies. Medical services outside Managua are limited, including for victims of crime. Government hospitals are understaffed and some hospitals throughout the country may not be able to assist in emergencies. Tap water is not reliably potable. Drink only purified bottled water.</p>
<p>Travelers should exercise increased caution and remain alert to the risks of crime. These include violent crimes such as sexual assault and armed robbery.<br>
<br>
Poor infrastructure can limit the Embassy&#8217;s emergency assistance to U.S. citizens. Travel by U.S. government personnel may be restricted at any time.<br>

<p>If you decide to travel to Nicaragua:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consider arrangements to depart the country quickly.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Ensure your U.S. passport is valid for your entire stay.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Avoid demonstrations and restrict unnecessary travel.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Do not attempt to drive through crowds, barricades, or roadblocks.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Maintain adequate supplies of food, cash, potable water, and fuel in case you need to shelter in place.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Use caution when walking or driving at night.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Keep a low profile.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Do not display signs of wealth such as expensive watches or jewelry.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Remain aware of your surroundings.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Develop a communication plan with family and/or your employer or host organization.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Be prepared for the high risk of indefinite arbitrary detention on false<u> </u>charges without consular access.&nbsp;</li>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Exercise increased caution in Bosnia and Herzegovina due to&nbsp;<b>terrorism, crime,&nbsp;</b>and<b>&nbsp;land mines</b>.</p>
<p><b>Country Summary:&nbsp;</b>Terrorist groups continue plotting possible attacks in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, targeting tourist locations, transportation hubs, markets/shopping malls, local government facilities, hotels, clubs, restaurants, places of worship, parks, major sporting and cultural events, educational institutions, airports, and other public areas. Theft and other crimes of opportunity are common, especially against tourists. Violent crimes, such as robbery and murder, also occur due to the availability of firearms remaining from the war. Minefields and land mines are present throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina. While suspected hazardous areas are normally clearly marked, several people are killed or injured each year.</p>

      <pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024</pubDate>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><i>Updated to reflect change in Travel Advisory from a Level 3 to a Level 2 and removing the &#8220;E&#8221; (time-limited event) indicator related to the catastrophic 2023 fuel depot explosion and its after-effects.</i></p>
<p>Exercise increased caution in Guinea due to <b>crime</b>, <b>civil unrest</b>, and <b>inadequate health infrastructure</b>.</p>
<p><b>Country Summary:&nbsp;</b>There is considerable risk of crimes of opportunity in Guinea, especially in Conakry, such as pickpocketing, purse snatching, theft of valuables from vehicles, assaults, and residential burglaries. Travelers should be especially alert in crowded areas where people congregate, such as markets.</p>
<p><b>Demonstrations </b>and<b> protests</b> occur unpredictably in Guinea and occasionally result in violence. If traveling outside the Conakry peninsula, make all efforts to complete your travel before nightfall. There are increased safety hazards and security concerns at night. U.S. government employees under Chief of Mission authority are restricted from traveling between cities after dark and are unable to provide emergency services at night.</p>
<p>Guinea&#8217;s <b>health infrastructure </b>is inadequate. Health services, hygiene, and quality control do not meet U.S. standards of care. Local drinking water is unsafe, pharmacies are not well regulated, locally available medications may be unsafe, and necessary healthcare may not be available.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><i>Reconsider travel to Honduras due to <b>crime</b>.&nbsp;Read the entire Travel Advisory.</i></p>
<p>Do not travel to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gracias a Dios Department, most eastern department, due to&nbsp;<b>crime</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Country Summary</b>: Violent crime, such as homicide, armed robbery, and kidnapping, remains common. Violent gang activity, such as extortion, violent street crime, rape, narcotics, and human trafficking, is widespread. Local authorities may lack sufficient resources to respond effectively to serious crime incidents. Around resort areas in the Bay Islands, which include Roatan, Utila, and Guanaja, there is a concentration of resources, and these areas are better policed.</p>
<p>Demonstrations occur regularly throughout the country and can be about a variety of political or economic issues. Protests, demonstrations, tire burnings, and roadblocks are frequent, unpredictable, and can turn violent.&nbsp;They can shutdown roads and highways, often without prior notice or estimated reopening timelines.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In December 2022, the Government of Honduras declared a &#8220;State of Exception&#8221; in response to high levels of extortion and other crimes. The declaration remains in effect and has been modified to include more cities. It allows the police to suspend constitutional rights in 226 of the country&#8217;s 298 municipalities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Honduran Ministry of Health declared in June 2024 a national emergency in Honduras due to an increase in dengue cases. The Ministry of Health has carried out dengue prevention, control, and surveillance activities, along with the promotion of preventive measures through the media and educational campaigns. It also carried out clean-up operations and campaigns, including the use of chemical and biological agents for vector control.</p>

<p><b>Transnistria &#8211; Level 3: Reconsider Travel</b></p>
<p>Transnistria. There is also military conflict in nearby Ukraine.</p>
<p>Transnistria is a region that is not under the control of the Moldovan government. Visitors must show identification to cross into Transnistria. Those without a Moldovan government-issued identification document will have to show a passport. Visitors may also have to show ID such as a passport at checkpoints. This is at roads leading into and out of the region. Ukraine has closed its border crossing points into the Transnistrian region. Taking photographs of military facilities and security forces is not allowed and may result in trouble with authorities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The U.S. government&#8217;s ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens traveling in Transnistria maybe be limited or delayed since Transnistria&#8217;s de facto authorities control access to the region.</p>

      <pubDate>Wed, 27 Nov 2024</pubDate>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Exercise increased caution due to the <b>arbitrary enforcement of local laws.</b></p>
<p><b>Summary:</b> Hong Kong SAR authorities have dramatically restricted civil liberties since the Government of the People&#8217;s Republic of China (PRC) imposed the Law of the PRC on Safeguarding National Security in the Hong Kong SAR on June 30, 2020. Following the Hong Kong SAR government&#8217;s enactment of its own Safeguarding National Security Ordinance on March 23, 2024, Hong Kong SAR authorities are expected to take additional actions to further restrict civil liberties.</p>
<p>The 2020 National Security Law outlines a broad range of vaguely defined offenses, such as acts of secession, subversion, terrorism, and collusion with foreign entities. The 2024 Safeguarding National Security Ordinance builds on this framework with additional vaguely defined offenses, such as treason, insurrection, theft of state secrets, sabotage against public infrastructure, and external interference. According to the legislation, these offenses are applicable to foreign nationals within the Hong Kong SAR and to individuals, including U.S. citizens and permanent residents, located outside its borders. Under these provisions, anyone who criticizes the PRC and/or Hong Kong SAR authorities may face arrest, detention, expulsion, and/or prosecution. Hong Kong SAR authorities are attempting to enforce these provisions against individuals, including U.S. citizens and permanent residents, residing outside their jurisdiction by offering cash rewards for information leading to their arrests in the Hong Kong SAR.</p>
<p><b>Dual nationality: </b>&nbsp;The Hong Kong SAR government does not recognize dual nationality. Dual U.S.-PRC citizens and U.S. citizens of Chinese descent may be subject to additional security and harassment. If you are a dual U.S.-PRC citizen and enter Hong Kong SAR on a U.S. passport, and you are detained or arrested, PRC authorities are under an obligation to notify the U.S. Embassy or a U.S. Consulate General of your detention and to allow U.S. consular officials to have access to you. In reality, however, U.S. consular officers may be prevented from providing consular assistance, even to those who have entered on their U.S. passports.

<p><b>Demonstrations: </b>Participating in demonstrations or other activities that authorities interpret as constituting an act of secession, subversion, terrorism, or collusion with a foreign country could result in criminal charges under the 2020 National Security Law and/or the 2024 Safeguarding National Security Ordinance. Be aware of your surroundings and avoid demonstrations.</p>

<p>Even in an emergency, the PRC Ministry of Foreign Affairs requires all U.S. diplomatic personnel, including those accredited to the Macau SAR, to apply for and receive visas before entering the Macau SAR. This takes at least five to seven days, significantly limiting the U.S. government&#8217;s ability to offer timely consular services in the Macau SAR.</p>
<p><b>Dual nationality: </b>The Macau SAR government does not recognize dual nationality. Dual U.S.-PRC citizens and U.S. citizens of Chinese descent may be subject to additional security and harassment. If you are a dual U.S.-PRC citizen awnd enter the Macau SAR on a U.S. passport, and you are detained or arrested, PRC authorities are under an obligation to notify the U.S. Embassy or a U.S. Consulate General of your detention and to allow U.S. consular officials to have access to you.

      <description><![CDATA[<p><i><b>Reissued with updates after periodic review.</b></i></p>
<p><b>Do not travel to Ukraine due to Russia&#8217;s war against Ukraine.&nbsp;</b>The Department of State continues to advise U.S. citizens to not travel to frontline regions of Ukraine and areas along Ukraine&#8217;s border with Belarus due to presence of Russian and Belarusian military and security forces on the Belarusian side of the border, proximity to active ground combat, frequent shelling, missile and drone attacks on populated areas and civilian infrastructure, and limitations on the Embassy&#8217;s ability to provide assistance to U.S. citizens in those areas. Read the entire Travel Advisory.<b></b></p>
<p><b>Some regions may have lower level of risk due to air defense capabilities and distance from active combat zones.</b></p>
<p><b>Level 3: Reconsider Travel to the regions of Volyn, Lviv, Zakarpattia, Ivano-Frankivsk, Chernivtsi, Ternopil, Rivne, Khmelnytskyi and Zhytomyr. <br>
</b>Russia&#8217;s unprovoked full-scale invasion of Ukraine continues, and even non-frontline regions remain subject to Russian missile and drone attacks. Travelers should react to air alerts and seek appropriate shelter. The security situation can change quickly, and travelers should be prepared to depart immediately with little to no warning. Closed airspace restricts travel options, and non-frontline regions are still subject to martial law restrictions, such as a nationwide curfew. U.S. government employees are subject to movement, curfew, and activity restrictions that may be more limited than Ukrainian government restrictions under martial law.<b></b></p>
<p>All U.S. citizens should carefully monitor U.S. government notices and local and international media outlets for information about changing security conditions and alerts to shelter in place. The security situation in Ukraine remains unpredictable.</p>
<p>U.S. citizens in Ukraine should stay vigilant and take appropriate steps to increase their security awareness in the event of military attacks. Download and turn on notifications for free mobile applications &#8211; which U.S. government personnel in Ukraine are required to have and monitor &#8211; that announce air alerts in real time, such as <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%96%D1%82%D1%80%D1%8F%D0%BD%D0%B0-%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%B0/id1611955391">Air Raid Siren</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%80%D1%82%D0%B0-%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B3/id1617641432">Alarm Map</a>. The U.S. Embassy does not have the ability to provide real-time alerts to the general U.S. citizen community of air threats. Know the location of your closest shelter at all times. In the event of mortar, missile, drone, or rocket fire, follow instructions from local authorities and seek shelter immediately. If you feel your current location is no longer safe, you should carefully assess the potential risks involved in moving to a different location.</p>
<p>On February 24, 2022, the Ukrainian government declared a state of emergency. Each region (oblast) decides on measures to be implemented according to local conditions. Measures could include curfews, restrictions on the freedom of movement, ID verification, and increased security inspections, among other measures. Follow any oblast-specific state of emergency measures.</p>
<p>Ukrainian law does not recognize dual nationality, and Ukraine will not recognize your U.S. citizenship if you are also a citizen of Ukraine. Dual citizens will be treated as Ukrainian citizens while in Ukraine and will be required to use a Ukrainian passport upon entry and exit of the country. Men aged 18-60 with Ukrainian citizenship are also subject to exit restrictions and possible mobilization during the period of martial law. The U.S. Embassy in Kyiv has received numerous reports of dual U.S.-Ukrainian citizens encountering significant difficulties both entering and exiting Ukraine. Travelers with family ties to Ukraine should consult the nearest Ukrainian Embassy or Consulate regarding potential citizenship obligations before entering Ukraine. For more information on traveling with dual nationality, please visit our <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/Dual-Nationality-Travelers.html">Travelers with Dual Nationality</a> page.</p>
<p>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Air Missions (NOTAM) prohibiting U.S. aviation operations into, out of, within, or over Ukraine. For more information, U.S. citizens should consult the FAA&#8217;s&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/ukraine-travel-advisory.html#ExternalPopup">Prohibitions, Restrictions, and Notices</a>.</p>
<p>U.S. citizens seeking assistance, including routine services, should email <a href="mailto:KyivACS@state.gov">KyivACS@state.gov</a>. Please review <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/what-state-dept-can-cant-do-crisis.html">what the U.S. government can and cannot do to assist you in a crisis overseas</a>.</p>
<p><b>The Embassy is open and operating in Kyiv; however, Embassy personnel are subject to movement, curfew, and activity restrictions, which may cause delays in provision of consular assistance to U.S. citizens outside of Kyiv.</b></p>
<p><b>Occupied Territories:</b><br>
Most of the international community, including the United States and Ukraine, do not recognize Russia&#8217;s purported annexation of Crimea in 2014, nor the September 2022 purported annexation of four other Ukrainian oblasts -- Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia. There is extensive Russian Federation military presence in many parts of these oblasts. There are also abuses against foreigners and the local population by the occupation authorities in these regions, particularly against those who are seen as challenging Russia&#8217;s occupation.</p>
<p>There are instances of Russian forces and their proxies singling out U.S. citizens in Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine for detention, interrogation, or harassment because of their nationality. U.S. citizens have also been singled out when evacuating by land through Russia-occupied territory or to Russia or Belarus.</p>
<p>Although Russia&#8217;s occupation severely restricts the Embassy&#8217;s access and ability to provide services in these areas, the Department of State and the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv continue to remotely provide certain emergency consular services to U.S. citizens in Crimea as well as four other Ukrainian oblasts partially occupied by Russia &#8211; Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><b><i>Updated to reflect Travel Advisory Level Change from 1 to a 2 due to Terrorism, Crime, Civil Unrest, and Kidnapping.</i></b></p>
<p>Exercise Increased Caution in Togo.<b> </b>Some areas have increased risk. Read the entire Travel Advisory.</p>
<p><b>Country Summary: </b>Criminals and terrorist groups are active in Togo, particularly in areas bordering Burkina Faso and Northern Benin. Attacks in these areas can occur with little or no warning, and could target shops, markets, hotels, places of worship, restaurants, bars, schools, government buildings, transportation hubs, and other places where crowds gather. Violent attacks are far more likely in the northern areas of Togo than in the southern and coastal areas.</p>
<p>Crimes such as robbery and assault occur in Togo. These crimes often happen at night and in isolated locations. &nbsp;Crime occurs more frequently in urban areas, near the beach, and in crowded markets.</p>
<p>Small protests have occurred in urban areas. Police have used tear gas to disperse protests that caused traffic disruptions in city centers and along National Route 1, and they have arrested protesters. Security forces have used force to disperse crowds and authorities have cut internet and cell services.</p>
<p><b>Do Not Travel to</b>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Northern border region adjacent to Burkina Faso due to potential for&nbsp;<b>terrorism&nbsp;</b>and<b>&nbsp;kidnapping</b>.</li>
<li>Areas north of Kande due to potential for&nbsp;<b>terrorism</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Read the&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Togo.html">country information page</a>&nbsp;for additional information about travel to Togo.</p>
<p><b>If you decide to travel to Togo:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Keep a low profile.</li>
<li>Be aware of your surroundings.</li>
<li>Stay alert in locations frequented by Westerners.</li>
<li>Be extra vigilant when visiting banks or ATMs.</li>

<p><b>Northern Border Region &#8211; Level 4: Do Not Travel</b><br>
Extremist groups have carried out attacks, including kidnappings, in the northern border region of Togo, the adjacent areas of Burkina Faso, and Benin. Attacks may occur with little or no warning. The current travel policy for embassy personnel prohibits travel north of the town of Dapaong and Highway N24 or Highway N28, along with the district of Kpendjal and Kpendjal-Ouest without special authorization. Embassy personnel may not remain overnight in areas north of Mango. The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in these areas. Due to security incidents, the Savanes region is under a Government of Togo state of emergency, and non-Togolese travelers must obtain special authorization to travel in the Savanes.</p>

      <title>Greenland - Level 2: Exercise Increased Caution</title>
      <link>https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/greenland-travel-advisory.html</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 29 Oct 2024</pubDate>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><b><i>Updated to reflect a new separate travel advisory from the Kingdom of Denmark.</i></b></p>
<p>Exercise increased caution in Greenland due to&nbsp;<b>environmental hazards posed by extreme weather conditions&nbsp;</b>and<b>&nbsp;limited emergency services.</b></p>
<p><b>Country Summary:&nbsp;</b>The U.S. government&#8217;s ability to provide consular services to U.S. citizens in Greenland is extremely limited.</p>
<p>Greenland&#8217;s landscape includes vast stretches of territory remote from cities and settlements. The weather can be harsh, and resources to provide emergency services in areas distant from cities and large settlements, including search and rescue, are scarce. In some areas, search and rescue efforts could take several days to reach the site of an incident.</p>
<p>Read the&#8239;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Greenland.html">country information page</a>&#8239;for additional information on travel to Greenland.</p>
<p>If you decide to travel&nbsp;to Greenland:&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Obtain comprehensive travel, medical, and evacuation insurance; see our webpage for more&#8239;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html">information on insurance coverage abroad</a>.</li>
<li>Travel with a professional guide or organization, such as those that are a member of the&nbsp;<a href="https://aeco.no/">Association of Arctic Expedition Cruise Operators</a>, or, if organizing a private expedition, be self-sufficient.</li>
<li>Enroll in the&nbsp;<a href="https://step.state.gov/step/">Smart Traveler Enrollment Program</a>&nbsp;(<a href="https://step.state.gov/step/">STEP</a>) to receive security messages and make it easier to locate you in an emergency.</li>
<li>Prepare a contingency plan for emergency situations. Review the&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/go/checklist.html">Traveler&#8217;s Checklist</a>.</li>
<li>Understand Greenland is a self-governing part of the Kingdom of Denmark. Greenland has assumed responsibility for the administration of health, education, taxation, and family and social matters (among other competencies), meaning these matters are handled differently than in Denmark.</li>

      <title>Saudi Arabia - Level 2: Exercise Increased Caution</title>
      <link>https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/saudi-arabia-travel-advisory.html</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 09 Sep 2024</pubDate>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><b><i>Updated to reflect current security conditions and other minor edits.</i></b></p>
<p>Exercise increased caution in Saudi Arabia due to&nbsp;the<b> threat of missile and drone attacks from Yemen </b>and&nbsp;<b>terrorism. </b>Some areas have increased risk. Read the entire Travel Advisory. Be aware of risks concerning<b> social media activity </b>and<b> importation of prohibited items</b>.</p>
<p>Do not travel to the following locations due to the threat of&nbsp;<b>missile and drone attacks</b>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<b>terrorism</b>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Within 20 miles of the Saudi-Yemen border, including the city of Najran</li>
<li>Qatif in the Eastern Province and its suburbs, including Awamiyah.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Country Summary:</b>&nbsp;U.S. Embassy and Consulate personnel must adhere to the above travel restrictions. The U.S. government has limited ability to assist U.S. citizens in the above locations.</p>
<p>The Houthis have perpetrated<b> missile and drone attacks</b>&nbsp;in Saudi Arabia. Attacks have been rare since the announcement of a truce between Saudi Arabia, the Houthi rebels, and the internationally recognized Government of Yemen. Recent Houthi attacks have focused on vessels in Red Sea shipping lanes. The Houthis have also threatened to renew attacks against Saudi Arabia. Past attacks have been aimed at targets throughout the country. Cities, infrastructure, airports, military bases and energy facilities have all been targeted. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Debris from intercepted drones and missiles has also been a risk. U.S. citizens living and working near infrastructure and military bases and infrastructure are at increased risk if attacks reoccur. The risk is most pronounced near the border with Yemen.</p>
<p><b>Terrorism</b>&nbsp;continues to be a concern in Saudi Arabia. Attacks can occur with little or no warning. Terrorists have targeted Saudi and international interests. Religious sites and other places frequented by U.S. citizens have been targeted. Globally, terrorists are using less sophisticated methods of attack &#8211; including knives, firearms, and vehicles. Targets often include tourist locations, large gatherings, transportation hubs, markets, shopping malls, and government facilities. Terrorists are also known to time attacks around major holidays and/or in response to military operations.</p>
<p><b>Social media activity</b>&nbsp;Saudi authorities deem critical, offensive, or disruptive to public order, could lead to&nbsp;<b>arrest</b>. U.S. citizens have been arrested for past social media activity and comments made while outside of Saudi Arabia. This may include posting, re-posting, or liking comments critical of Saudi institutions, policies, or public life. Saudi laws on cybercrime and terrorism are used to prosecute these cases. Punishment for social media activity has included prison sentences of up to 45 years. Saudi courts do not necessarily consider the timeframe of the posts, or the location from which they were made, to be material.</p>
<p><b>It is illegal to bring drugs (including marijuana), drug paraphernalia, or alcohol into Saudi Arabia. Importing gambling-related items, weapons, or pork is prohibited. Bringing materials that could be considered obscene or suggestive into Saudi Arabia is also prohibited</b>. Penalties are severe by U.S. standards. For more information, please see the <a href="https://zatca.gov.sa/en/HelpCenter/FAQs/Pages/FAQArchiveEservices.aspx?cat=15">Saudi Arabia Customs Authority website</a>.</p>
<p>Due to risks to civil aviation operating within the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman region, including Saudi Arabia, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued an advisory Notice to Air Missions (NOTAM). For more information U.S. citizens should consult the&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/saudi-arabia-travel-advisory.html#ExternalPopup">Federal Aviation Administration&#8217;s Prohibitions, Restrictions and Notices</a>.</p>

<p>Reconsider travel to New Caledonia due to&nbsp;<b>civil unrest and crime</b>.</p>
<p>U.S. citizens should reconsider travel to New Caledonia or consider departing by commercial or other privately available transportation options, in light of the current security situation and infrastructure challenges following riots related to electoral reform in May 2024.

<p>Protests, demonstrations, tire burning, and roadblocks are frequent, unpredictable, and have turned violent. During civil unrest, commercial transportation may become unavailable without warning for U.S. citizens wishing to depart New Caledonia. The U.S. government is extremely limited in its ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in&nbsp;New Caledonia &#8211; assistance on site is available only from local authorities.</p>

      <pubDate>Mon, 15 Apr 2024</pubDate>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><b>Updated with information about land border travel restrictions.</b></p>
<p>Exercise increased caution in Ecuador due to&nbsp;<b>civil unrest</b>,&nbsp;<b>crime</b>, and&nbsp;<b>kidnapping</b>. Some areas have increased risk. Read the entire Travel Advisory.</p>
<p>Do not travel to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Guayaquil,&nbsp;<b>south</b>&nbsp;of Portete de Tarqui Avenue, due to&nbsp;<b>crime</b>.</li>
<li>The cities of Huaquillas and Arenillas in the province of El Oro, due to&nbsp;<b>crime</b>.</li>

<li>The canton of Duran, in the province of Guayas, due to <b>crime</b>.</li>
<li>Esmeraldas city and all areas north of Esmeraldas city in Esmeraldas province, due to&nbsp;<b>crime</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Reconsider travel to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Guayaquil&nbsp;<b>north</b>&nbsp;of Portete de Tarqui Avenue due to&nbsp;<b>crime</b>.</li>

<li>The provinces of Sucumbios, Manabi, Santa Elena, and Santo Domingo due to&nbsp;<b>crime</b>.</li>

<p><b>Country Summary:</b> Crime is a widespread problem in Ecuador. Violent crime, such as murder, assault, kidnapping, and armed robbery, is prevalent and widespread. The rate of violent crime is significantly higher in areas where transnational criminal organizations are concentrated.</p>
<p>Demonstrations occur frequently throughout the country, usually motivated by political and/or economic factors. Demonstrators routinely block local roads and major highways, often without prior notice which can lead to disruption in access to critical infrastructure. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Outside of Ecuador&#8217;s major towns and cities, much of the country&#8217;s territory is sparsely populated and isolated. Government assistance may be very limited and can lead to significant delays for assistance to U.S. citizens in remote areas.</p>
<p><b>Land Border Restrictions</b>: All foreign citizens entering the country via land border crossings from Colombia or Peru are required to present an apostilled certificate showing a lack of criminal record. Further information is available on the <a href="https://www.turismo.gob.ec/requisitos-de-ingreso-al-ecuador-continental-e-islas-galapagos/">Ministry of Tourism&#8217;s webpage</a> and at <a href="https://ecuador.travel/viaja-seguro/">Ecuador.Travel</a>.

<p><b>Northern Border Region &#8211; Level 4: Do Not Travel</b></p>
<p>The main terrorist threat to C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire is from a group called Jama&#8217;at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM). JNIM is linked to al-Qa&#8217;ida. JNIM mostly operates in the Sahel region, including Burkina Faso and Mali.&nbsp; The threat from JNIM has in the past reached northern C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, near the border with Burkina Faso. &nbsp;Attacks have happened in the Savanes and Zanzan Districts, including Como&#233; National Park. &nbsp;These attacks have mainly targeted Ivoirian security forces, but civilians have also been targeted. &nbsp;In 2021, Al-Qa&#8217;ida in the Lands of the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) carried out 17 small-scale attacks that killed approximately 20 people. &nbsp;After these attacks, the C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire government increased security in northern C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire. &nbsp;Since 2021, there have been no attacks.</p>]]></description>

      <pubDate>Mon, 31 Jul 2023</pubDate>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><b><i>Reissued with obsolete COVID-19 page links removed.</i></b></p>
<p>Exercise increased caution in Eritrea due to <b>travel restrictions, limited consular assistance, landmines,</b> and<b> wrongful detentions.</b></p>
<p><b>Country Summary:</b> The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in Eritrea, as U.S. government employees must obtain special authorization to travel outside of Asmara.</p>
<p>U.S. citizens visiting or residing in Eritrea, including dual U.S.-Eritrean nationals, have been arrested and detained without charge or on false charges.&nbsp; The Department has determined that the risk of wrongful detention of U.S. nationals by the Eritrean government exists.</p>
<p>Eritrean law enforcement officials routinely block access by U.S. government officials to U.S. citizens in detention. &nbsp;The U.S. Embassy therefore may not receive notification of your arrest or be allowed access to you if you are detained or arrested.</p>
<p>There are landmines in many remote areas in Eritrea, particularly in Nakfa, AdiKeih, Arezza, the 25 mile-wide region (40 km) between the Setit and Mereb Rivers, and in areas north and west of Keren, areas near Massawa, Ghinda, Agordat, Barentu, Dekemhare, and south of Tessenae.</p>
<p>Read the&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Eritrea.html">country information page</a>&nbsp;for additional information on travel to Eritrea.</p>
<p>If you decide to travel to Eritrea:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use caution when walking and hiking in remote areas or off main roads.</li>
<li>Always carry a copy of your U.S. passport and visa (if applicable). Keep original documents in a secure location.</li>
<li>Enroll in the&nbsp;<a href="https://step.state.gov/step/">Smart Traveler Enrollment Program</a>&nbsp;(<a href="https://step.state.gov/step/">STEP</a>) to receive Alerts and make it easier to locate you in an emergency.</li>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><b><i>Reissued with obsolete COVID-19 page links removed.</i></b></p>
<p>Reconsider travel to Ethiopia due to&nbsp;<b>sporadic violent</b> <b>conflict, civil unrest, crime, communications disruptions, terrorism and kidnapping in border areas</b>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Tigray Region and border with Eritrea due to&nbsp;<b>sporadic violent</b> <b>conflict, civil unrest, and crime</b>.</li>
<li>Afar-Tigray<b>&nbsp;</b>border areas<b>&nbsp;due</b>&nbsp;to&nbsp;sporadic violent <b>conflict, civil unrest, and crime</b>.</li>

</ul>
<p>The security situation in Addis Ababa is stable. However, there is sporadic violent conflict and civil unrest in other areas of Ethiopia, and the security situation may deteriorate without warning. The U.S. Embassy is unlikely to be able to assist with departure from the country if the security situation deteriorates. Due to sporadic violent conflict and civil unrest throughout parts of Ethiopia, travel by U.S. government personnel is routinely assessed for additional restrictions. Please see information on&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/what-state-dept-can-cant-do-crisis.html">What the Department of State Can and Can't Do in a Crisis</a><b>.</b></p>
<p>U.S. officials have limited ability to provide services to U.S. citizens outside of Addis Ababa and have very limited consular access to U.S. citizens detained by Ethiopian authorities. The government of Ethiopia has&nbsp;previously restricted or shut down internet, cellular data, and phone services before, during, and after civil unrest. These restrictions impede the U.S. Embassy&#8217;s ability to communicate with and provide consular services to U.S. citizens in Ethiopia.</p>
<p>Please contact the Embassy&#8217;s American Citizen Services Unit at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:AddisACS@state.gov">AddisACS@state.gov</a>&nbsp;for further assistance.</p>
<p>Read the&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Ethiopia.html">country information page&nbsp;</a>for additional information about travel to Ethiopia.</p>

<li>Be aware of your surroundings.</li>
<li>Stay alert in locations frequented by U.S. citizens/Westerners/foreign travelers.</li>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Reissued with updates to the security situation and post departure status.</p>
<p>Do not travel to Sudan due to&nbsp;armed conflict, civil unrest,&nbsp;crime, terrorism, and kidnapping.</p>
<p>On April 22, 2023, the U.S. Embassy in Khartoum suspended its operations, and the Department of State ordered the departure of U.S. direct hire employees and eligible family members from Embassy Khartoum due to the continued threat of armed conflict in Sudan. The U.S. government cannot provide routine or emergency consular services to U.S. citizens in Sudan, due to the current security situation.</p>
<p>Armed conflict is ongoing throughout Sudan and includes heavy fighting between various political and security groups. The situation is violent, volatile, and extremely unpredictable, particularly in the capital city Khartoum. Electrical and communication disruptions, including internet and cell phone service, can occur at any time.&nbsp; Khartoum International Airport and Sudan&#8217;s border with Chad are currently closed.</p>
<p><b>Country Summary</b>: Armed conflict, crime, such as kidnapping, armed robbery, home invasion, and carjacking occur.</p>
<p>Members of known terrorist groups and individuals sympathetic to these groups in Sudan could attack with little or no warning, targeting foreign and local government facilities, and areas frequented by Westerners.</p>
<p>Violence continues along the border between Chad and Sudan and areas that border South Sudan (including the disputed Abyei area). Armed opposition groups are active in Central Darfur state and parts of Blue Nile and South Kordofan states. Intercommunal clashes can occur throughout the country and can result in the declaration of localized States of Emergency.</p>
